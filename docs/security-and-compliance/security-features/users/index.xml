      <description>What is two factor authentication? Simply put, it helps to keep your company’s data more secure, to stop outsiders stealing it, editing or even deleting it.&#xA;When someone logs in from a new device or location, the system will prompt them for a code sent to or generated by their phone, to prove their identity.&#xA;If you’d like to dive into more detail, check out this video from authy.com: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds_TANz4n3U&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</description>

For example, you may wish your suppliers to be able to upload certificates of conformances to items they sell you, or you may have a large workforce of contractors who you require to fill in timesheets.</description>
