        &lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-a-user&#34;&gt;Adding a user&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Administration&lt;/em&gt; menu in the lefthand sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll see a list of existing users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the plus button in the toolbar at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see an editing screen with the details of the user you just created.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/user-details.png&#34; alt=&#34;User editing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enter the user&amp;rsquo;s name and username. If the username isn&amp;rsquo;t their email address, enter their email address in the field provided too. This is useful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to allow them to reset their own password by receiving a link by email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to allow them to receive notifications when another user adds a comment against a record&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as various features allow a user to be assigned to a record. Workflows can be set up to email those users. E.g. if an account manager is assigned to a customer, you may want to email them when a complaint is received from that customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;passwords&#34;&gt;Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended way to set passwords is for the user to choose their own, which they can do once they have a username and email address filled in. They will need to visit the login page, click the &amp;lsquo;forgotten password&amp;rsquo; link and type in their username. They will be emailed a link which will let them set a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an administrator, you can also manually reset a user&amp;rsquo;s password by clicking &amp;lsquo;change password&amp;rsquo; in their user details screen.
Passwords are required to be at least 8 characaters long. Apart from that, there are no rules. However, all passwords entered are checked against the &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&#34;&gt;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&lt;/a&gt; website. Any password that is found in their database of &amp;lsquo;breaches&amp;rsquo; is not allowed to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend the adoption of a password wallet service like &lt;a href=&#34;https://1password.com/&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lastpass.com&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; or built-in browser features to generate and store passwords. That lets passwords become much more secure and harder to guess whilst not requiring users to remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-factor-authentication&#34;&gt;Two factor authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are strongly encouraged to set up two factor authentication (2FA) using an app. Unfortunately this is one step an administrator can&amp;rsquo;t do for them, but luckily it is quick and easy to do: &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s how&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users without 2FA will be prompted to do so in the user interface and by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2FA is mandatory for &lt;a href=&#34;#roles&#34;&gt;administrators&lt;/a&gt; and necessary for a user to have before &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;manage&lt;/a&gt; privileges can be assigned to them. Users also need to have 2FA enabled in order to perform certain functions such as exporting to spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enabled, a user will be prompted for the 2FA code as well as their password when they log in from a device or location they haven&amp;rsquo;t used in the past 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user encounters any problems with 2FA, e.g. they lose the device for generating their codes, you can temporarily disable 2FA on their account by going to their user details screen and un-ticking &amp;lsquo;use 2FA&amp;rsquo;. Of course, you need to be aware of the risks, for example double checking that a user who contacts you is really who they say they are. Once they can log in, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to enable 2FA themselves again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone can&amp;rsquo;t use app-based 2FA for some reason, then a fallback option is to use text-message (SMS) based authentication. This is not recommended as there are known insecurities in this method, but it&amp;rsquo;s still better than having no 2FA at all. To enable that, just type in the user&amp;rsquo;s mobile phone number when editing their user details. That phone number isn&amp;rsquo;t used for any other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-options&#34;&gt;Other options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the custom AgileChilli UI rather than agileBase&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s possible for companies to apply their logo and custom login screen to the system. Please contact us if you&amp;rsquo;d like to set this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logout after&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Automatically end the user&amp;rsquo;s session after after this many minutes of inactivity. The user themselves can also change this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;roles&#34;&gt;Roles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tick a role to assign the user to it. The primary purpose of roles is to apply privileges to groups of users, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;roles&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one special role which can be assigned. It will be marked &lt;strong&gt;grants administrative privileges&lt;/strong&gt;. Assigning that role will make a user an administrator, with full permissions over the complete system. They can create/remove users, roles, tables etc., as well as assign themselves privileges on any table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to each role listed is a list of tiles that will be added to their screen if that role is assigned to them. This is a convenience feature to speed up setting up their home screen. The tiles shown for a role are those which more than half of the members of that role have. Tiles can be manually added and removed by an &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;administrator&lt;/a&gt; or the user themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any role is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;filtering role&lt;/a&gt;, the filter applied is also displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;privileges&#34;&gt;Privileges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assign individual table &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;privileges&lt;/a&gt; to a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with larger numbers of users it&amp;rsquo;s usually more manageable if you use roles to assign privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a user has a privilege due to being a member of a role, that privilege is shown with a shaded blue background. Any additional privileges individually assigned to them are shown in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tiles&#34;&gt;Tiles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allows an admin to add/remove &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;tiles&lt;/a&gt; for a user. By default users can add/remove tiles themselves too, although this can be disabled through the use of a &lt;a href=&#34;#other-options&#34;&gt;custom UI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;viewing-users&#34;&gt;Viewing users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Administration&lt;/em&gt; menu in the lefthand sidebar and click users. You&amp;rsquo;ll see a list of existing user accounts. Their details are listed including 2FA status (whether they&amp;rsquo;re using app-based 2FA, text message codes or none) and when they last logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each user&amp;rsquo;s roles are shown. Any &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/#multi-tenanting&#34;&gt;multi-tenanting&lt;/a&gt; roles are marked in bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;removing-users&#34;&gt;Removing users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove users, when viewing the list of users, tick those to remove and press the delete (cross) button in the top toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user removal will have no effect on any data stored in the system. The user&amp;rsquo;s previous comments will still be visible for example and their username will still be logged against any records they&amp;rsquo;re marked as owner of. Their changes will still be in the audit trail and they will be marked as the creator/last editor of records where relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to take some other actions after deletion e.g. to re-assign records they are assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deleted user&amp;rsquo;s profile image will be replaced with a standard icon representing a deleted user, when displayed in comment streams etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Relational Database Concepts</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/relational-database-concepts/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/relational-database-concepts/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Before diving into the details of building applications, starting with tables, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and learn some background information about databases, including what a table is. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building back office software with agileBase, a large amount of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing is building database structures, to store user-entered data. agileBase takes care of creating the user interface to allow users to use these structures automatically, e.g. to search for data, add and edit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find many articles explaining relational databases if you look for them on the internet. Most will introduce SQL, the language used to work with databases. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to learn that as agileBase generates it automatically behind the scenes, but the higher level concepts are useful to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a YouTube video with a good introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvrpuBAMddw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer reading, here are a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simple-example---what-is-a-relation&#34;&gt;Simple example - what is a relation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine we want a place to store records of suppliers to our business. This could be the start of a supplier management system to compare companies based on quality, accreditation levels and price for example, or to carry out supplier approval processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this we need just one table &amp;lsquo;suppliers&amp;rsquo; which would have fields in such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few address fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;phone number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s just like creating a spreadsheet with column headings across the top for those fields. You can then add a row for each supplier you record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we communicate with our suppliers, we may want to store the contact details of a few key people at each supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, a naive spreadsheet user would add a few more columns (fields in database parlance), things like Contact Name 1, Phone 1, Email 1, Contact Name 2, Phone 2, Email 2. As you can imagine if there are more than one or two contacts, it would become pretty cumbersome and difficult to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our database we can easily do a lot better and create a separate table of contacts that links to the suppliers table - in fact it &lt;strong&gt;relates&lt;/strong&gt; to it. That&amp;rsquo;s why relational databases are so called, just because they&amp;rsquo;re very good at dealing with relations between tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have our contact table, maybe with fields&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct Line number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect them we add another field of a special type, called a &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt;. It can be called Company, but rather than storing the company name again (we already have stored the company name in the suppliers table), it will be a link to a particular company. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about how that works behind the scenes, just know that the Company relation links to a supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** TODO: diagram **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now add as many contacts as we like to a supplier. And if we decide to store some more data about each contact, maybe a link to their LinkedIn profile for example, we can add that field to the contacts table and it will automatically be there for all contacts (as opposed to our naive spreadsheet example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-more-complex-example&#34;&gt;A more complex example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a good start. Moving on, there&amp;rsquo;s one more type of relation it&amp;rsquo;s useful to understand - the &amp;lsquo;many to many&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our link between contacts and suppliers above is called a &amp;lsquo;one to many&amp;rsquo; (or sometimes many to one) relationship. The reason is simply that one supplier can have many contacts attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we think about a more complex case? Suppose our suppliers supply us with raw materials, for example ingredients and packaging. We may want to record which materials each supplier supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could set it up as above, where we have a raw materials table. A raw material has a relation field linking it to a supplier, so one supplier can supply many materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what happens if a particular raw material is supplied by more than one company? You may have a primary supplier, then various fallbacks for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d have to create a new raw material record for each supplier. That would be ok if our raw material record consisted of nothing more than a name and maybe a price, but there could be dozens or hundreds of fields added as we build up our system - to store nutritional information, chemical properties, allergens, etc. etc. That would mean lots of duplication to keep track of. And if we want to later build recipes which use our raw materials, we&amp;rsquo;d probably just want a recipe to refer to &amp;lsquo;flour&amp;rsquo;, not &amp;lsquo;flour from Supplier X&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to create a &lt;strong&gt;many to many&lt;/strong&gt; relation, where one supplier can provide many raw materials but also a single raw material can be linked to many different suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no new field type to get to know, we just use the standard one to many relation we&amp;rsquo;ve already learned about in a clever new way - we use two of them, plus a join table. The structure looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: diagram of junction table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table in the middle, Links, is called a join table, or junction table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a normal relation field linking it to suppliers, and also one linking to ingredients. By adding a record to the links table, we can join any ingredient to any supplier. A supplier can then have lots of ingredients, but an ingredient can also have lots of suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video above also explains this type of relation if you&amp;rsquo;ve not already watched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-to-use-the-many-to-many&#34;&gt;When to use the many to many&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have a niggling thought at the back of your mind: how do I know whether it&amp;rsquo;s best to use a simple one to many relation, or a more complex many to many setup? Surely I could use many to many for contacts and suppliers too? A single contact may be associated with more than one supplier, for example if they&amp;rsquo;re a contractor, or if they move jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to that just comes down to your judgement. Although agileBase creates a friendly, easy to use interface on top of the data structure, the many to many does add complexity. So it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a trade-off. However the advantage of a no-code system like agileBase is that you can rapidly try out ideas and see which one works best. As time goes on you&amp;rsquo;ll get a sense of what works best in which situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do want to learn more about this topic, it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;lsquo;database normalisation&amp;rsquo; and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty written about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that gives you a bit of background about what a table is, what a relation is and how they work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A table is a store of data about a single concept e.g. a company or contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A relation field links tables together e.g. a contact belongs to a company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many to many relations (created with a join table) are sometimes useful. They allow us to link many records of one table to many of another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all of the most important information you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know about data structures. The rest of the documentation will show you how to create applications practically. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Roles</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of roles is to apply privileges to groups of users, rather than applying them individually. That makes managing large numbers of users easier and also more secure as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which privileges each type of user has and which they don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roles have some other important uses, such as multi-tenanting, described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-role&#34;&gt;Creating a role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Administration&lt;/em&gt; menu in the lefthand sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;roles&lt;/em&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll see a list of existing roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the plus button in the toolbar at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see an editing screen with the details of the role you just created. You can give it a name and there are a couple of options:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/role-details.png&#34; alt=&#34;Role details&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow Export&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Referrs to exporting to spreadsheet - see &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;spreadsheet exports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Visibility&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Restrict Data Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are used to set up &lt;a href=&#34;#multi-tenanting&#34;&gt;multi-tenanting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;members&#34;&gt;Members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tick each user to add them to the role. Users will gain all the privileges defined by the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privileges&#34;&gt;Privileges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;table privileges&lt;/a&gt; which will apply to members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privileges are additive - if a user is a member of multiple roles, they gain all the privileges from each of those roles added together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multi-tenanting&#34;&gt;Multi-tenanting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-tenanting is the ability to separate users into groups who can’t see each other’s data. This can be used for example to allow different sets of companies, clubs, or membership groups (or whatever the organisational group is) to use the same system features whilst remaining separate from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-tenanting is a powerful feature that can be used not just for customers to segragate data amongst their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners can also use this facility if building software to widely market. In that case, each customer they sign up can very quickly be set up with their own private dataset, whilst the partner retains the ability to add features which will automatically apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up multi-tenanting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;add a text field&lt;/a&gt; to all tables in the system for which you want data to be segragated. The field must be named the same in every table, for example&amp;rsquo;s sake here let&amp;rsquo;s assume it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;lsquo;account name&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then create one role for each set of users who you want to segregate. We&amp;rsquo;ll assume there&amp;rsquo;s one called &amp;lsquo;Customer A&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the role details screen for the Customer A role, tick &lt;em&gt;user visibility&lt;/em&gt;. That means that users in this role won&amp;rsquo;t see users in other roles with the same option ticked. In other words, users from Customer A won&amp;rsquo;t be able to select Customer B or Customer C users when doing things like adding comments or assigning users to records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &lt;em&gt;restrict data access&lt;/em&gt; in the role details, enter &lt;code&gt;account name = Customer A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, ensure the account name field is present in all views based on the table. When creating a view, any fields used for multi-tenanting will automatically be added but you may need to retro-fit any existing views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has two effects -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user assigned to the Customer A role creates a new record in one of the multi-tenanting tables, the account name field will automatically be populated with the value Customer A (as entered under &lt;em&gt;restrict data access&lt;/em&gt;). The field will be invisible to them - they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see or edit the value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When looking at records in a view, a filter will be automatically applied so the user only sees records where account name = Customer A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users who &lt;strong&gt;aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong&gt; a member of the role will see the account name field in the data editing form and in views. This can be useful for allowing e.g. group managers to see all data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any multi-tenanting roles are set up, then views which &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong&gt; contain a multi-tenanting field will be marked in red in the administration interface, as a warning. If a multi-tenanting user loads one of these views, they will see all records. Typically, practically all views will need the multi-tenanting field to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;complex-multi-tenanting&#34;&gt;Complex multi-tenanting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;multi-level&#34;&gt;Multi-level&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users may be a member of more than one multi-tenanting role. For example you may use two multi-tenanting fields/roles, one for a company and another for a division. Members of a company role will be able to see data from all divisions in their company and members of both a company and a division role will only be able to see data for a single division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;multi-account-via-multiple-roles&#34;&gt;Multi-account (via multiple roles)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also possible for a user to be a member of multiple roles, all of which are set to multi-tenant on the same field, with different values. E.g. if a user is a member of Company A and Company B roles as in our example above, they will see data from those two companies when viewing records, but not Company C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works best when the user has read-only privileges on the data, e.g. for a manager reporting on those two companies. They can view records but not add new records, as the system is unable to determine the value of the account name field to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;multi-account-via-_contains_-filtering&#34;&gt;Multi-account (via &lt;em&gt;contains&lt;/em&gt; filtering)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to define a role filter under &lt;em&gt;restrict data access&lt;/em&gt; with a &amp;lsquo;contains&amp;rsquo; rather than an &amp;lsquo;=&amp;rsquo; filter. You can then use a naming convension for your account name values to allow members of this role to see multiple accounts. As above, users of this role will need to be read-only on the data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Privileges</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In agileBase, there are three privilege levels, as well as a special ‘administrator’ privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three privileges take effect per table, i.e. a user/role can have certain privileges on one table and different ones on another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privileges are additive - if a user is a member of multiple roles, they gain all the privileges from each of those roles added together, plus any they may have individually assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privilege-levels&#34;&gt;Privilege levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View&lt;/strong&gt;: ability to see data in a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: ability to create, edit and delete data in a table (create and delete subject to various table options)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage&lt;/strong&gt;: the privilege that allows you to use the &amp;lsquo;application building&amp;rsquo; features of agileBase, relating to a table. Namely the ability to
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modify the structure, i.e. create/delete fields, tabs, change options etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create, edit and delete views from the table, including creating charts, maps and word clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upload or create printout templates for views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;view usage statistics about a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage also allows some extended user features
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete any user&amp;rsquo;s comments from a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unlock locked records to allow editing (one at a time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;override table options which would normally disallow adding/removing records from a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;override options which would normally disallow exporting data to a spreadsheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;import data from spreadsheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global edit (bulk edit) data in the table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the &lt;strong&gt;administrator&lt;/strong&gt; privilege allows full permissions over the complete system. An administrator can create/remove users, roles, tables etc., as well as assign table privileges to any user, including themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrator privilege is the only one that allows the user to add new tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Factor Authentication is required for any user with manage or administrator privileges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assigning-table-privileges&#34;&gt;Assigning table privileges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table privileges can be assigned to one or more users or roles from that table&amp;rsquo;s editing screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a user or role editing screen, privileges on one or more tables can be assigned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two methods are equivalent, whichever is the most convenient for a given purpose can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing privileges by role rather than by individual user is recommended. That makes managing large numbers of users easier and also more secure as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which privileges each type of user has and which they don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assign one or more role or user privileges to a table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Build Tables&lt;/em&gt; section in the lefthand navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the pencil (edit) icon in the top toolbar (or click a record to load the editing screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; tab at the bottom of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;em&gt;roles&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; section, then select or un-select any privileges required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assign one or more table privileges to a particular role or user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Administration&lt;/em&gt; section of the lefthand navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;roles&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the role or user to assign privileges to, then select or un-select any privileges required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assigning-the-administrator-privilege&#34;&gt;Assigning the administrator privilege&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Administration&lt;/em&gt; section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the user to make an administrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;em&gt;roles&lt;/em&gt; section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tick the role marked &lt;strong&gt;Grants administrative privileges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;related-to-privileges&#34;&gt;Related to privileges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database systems often have the concept of row level privileges. The equivalent in agileBase is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/#multi-tenanting&#34;&gt;multi-tenanting&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual fields in a table can be locked or hidden, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;field options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Adding and removing</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/adding-and-removing/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/adding-and-removing/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A table is a store of data of a particular type e.g. a company, contact, product or invoice. Tables are the fundamental building blocks of an agileBase application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-a-table&#34;&gt;Adding a table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Build Tables&lt;/em&gt; menu in the lefthand sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;create a new table&lt;/em&gt; at the bottom of the list of existing tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If necessary, click the pencil icon in the toolbar to see the details of the table you just created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the table&amp;rsquo;s name and add a longer description under &lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. This description will be used as help text in the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;naming-tables&#34;&gt;Naming tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When naming a table, it&amp;rsquo;s best to use a plural form. Also avoid filler endings like &amp;lsquo;info&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;details&amp;rsquo;. So rather than &amp;lsquo;company info&amp;rsquo;, you might call a table &amp;lsquo;companies&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that the user interface will automatically convert plural names into singular forms where appropriate. So for example if there&amp;rsquo;s a plus button on the screen to allow the user to add a new record in the table, it will automatically recognise the table and title the button Add Company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build a large system with lots of tables, you may find it a good idea to prefix table names using a numbering/lettering system e.g.
&lt;code&gt;a) table 1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;b) table 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the administrator interface, tables are listed alphabetically, so you can arrange the tables into a logical order with this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface will strip out any prefixes when displaying names to users, if they end with a closing bracket &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;removing-a-table&#34;&gt;Removing a table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before removing a table, you first need to remove all views and fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to remove actual data records from the table first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of existing views is visible in the &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; tab of the table, at the top right. Visit each view and delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then next to the table&amp;rsquo;s manage tab is the &lt;em&gt;fields&lt;/em&gt; tab. Delete all the existing fields from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deleting views and fields, you may find you have to first delete other views or fields they depend on. In complex systems there can be chains of objects that need to be deleted in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deleting is a destructive process so is not highly automated on purpose, to avoid accidental deletion. However at each stage you&amp;rsquo;ll be shown any dependencies which have to be removed first, so you can follow through the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all views and fields have been deleted, you may need to reload the table by choosing it from the list under &lt;em&gt;Build Tables&lt;/em&gt;. In the &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; tab, the &lt;em&gt;Delete Table&lt;/em&gt; button should now be enabled and you can click it to perform the final step of the deletion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Exporting</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/exporting/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/exporting/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Exporting to spreadsheet is only one way of getting data out of agileBase, but it is the most commonly used amongst everyday users. For less ad-hoc data transfers, such as integrations with third party systems involving incoming and/or outgoing data, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;allowing-exports&#34;&gt;Allowing exports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a user to be allowed to export to spreadsheet, a number of critieria have to be matched, to suitably protect your organisation&amp;rsquo;s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user must have &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/users/#two-factor-authentication&#34;&gt;Two Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt; enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The view to export from must have exporting enabled (it&amp;rsquo;s enabled by default). To do this
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the tiles interface, open the view in question, click your user icon at the top right and select &lt;em&gt;admin - edit view&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tick &lt;em&gt;allow exports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user must also be a member of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/&#34;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; that allows exporting (disabled by default). To allow exporting for a role,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the admin interface, expand the &lt;em&gt;Administration&lt;/em&gt; menu in the lefthand sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click &lt;em&gt;roles&lt;/em&gt; and select the role you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tick &lt;em&gt;allow exports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges/&#34;&gt;manage privileges&lt;/a&gt; on the view&amp;rsquo;s parent table can bypass criteria 2 and 3. This privilege is not commonly applied to normal users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exporting&#34;&gt;Exporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user with the ability to export can do so by opening the view, clicking the print icon to the left and selecting &lt;em&gt;export to spreadsheet&lt;/em&gt; from the options at the top of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt; the data on screen before doing this, only the filtered data will be exported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting spreadsheet will be in Microsoft Excel format. The first sheet will be some metadata about the export, such as a timestamp, the name of the exporter and any filters applied. The second sheet will be the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Column A in the data sheet will be hidden. It holds the internal row ID of each record. This is useful for matching purposes if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be modifying then re-importing the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;charts&#34;&gt;Charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the view has &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt; attached, one sheet per chart will also be included in the spreadsheet. The contents will be the chart data, not the chart visualisation itself, but the visualisation can easily be re-created in the spreadsheet from the data if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limits-and-notifications&#34;&gt;Limits and notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An administrator can log whether each table contains commercially sensitive data (ticked by default) and/or personal data (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)&#34;&gt;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)&lt;/a&gt;. If either of these options is ticked for a view&amp;rsquo;s parent table, you’ll have additional options for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notifying all administrators if an export of more than a certain number of rows is done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting a hard limit to completely disallow exports of more than a certain number of rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To configure these options, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;tables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Reporting</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/usage-reporting/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/usage-reporting/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Log data reporting provides a rich view of system usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enhanced-audit-trail&#34;&gt;Enhanced audit trail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For organisations who have activated the enhanced audit trail, all logs are stored in user-accessible tables which are just like any other tables in the system, the only difference being the data is read only. This means an administrator can use the full power of the built in agileBase reporting features, to create views, add calculations, charts etc., even export via the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, you could analyse how many changes were made per month by each user, count the volume of logins from various locations or see what the most common fields are to search on. All actions listed on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/&#34;&gt;usage monitoring&lt;/a&gt; page are available to query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is also retained for an extended period, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/#retention-periods&#34;&gt;retention periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If interested in activating this feature, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilechilli.com/contact-us/&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;. There will be a small recurring charge added to your bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;standard-reporting&#34;&gt;Standard reporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built in reports are available in a number of areas, whether using the enhanced audit trail or standard logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-dashboard&#34;&gt;The dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the tiles interface, click the bird icon at the top left, then select &lt;em&gt;usage dashboard&lt;/em&gt;. The dashboard contains system reports including usage data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;trends&#34;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overall usage treemap is displayed at the top. Each view is a section of the screen. Large areas represent views that get a lot of use, smaller areas those that don’t. Colours give immediate feedback on whether usage has been increasing (blue) or decreasing (grey) this month. Hovering over an area shows more stats including the top users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath that a series of sparkline charts show long term trends, across selected operational, tactical and strategic metrics, all geared to showing utilisation over a 12 month period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw data can be downloaded to spreadsheet using the links beneath each sparkline. Note only the most recent 200,000 records can be downloaded in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;capacity&#34;&gt;Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as actual usage, the dashboard shows total capacity i.e. how many users, records, tables etc. are present in the system, along with purchased capacity (if relevant). These elements affect billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;workflows&#34;&gt;Workflows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convenience view of all workflows which carry out automated data modifications, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;workflows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;database-graph&#34;&gt;Database graph&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for background on what the data structure looks like and how tables are connected, the database graph shows relations between tables is visual form. This can provide a fuller understaning of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;table-and-view-usage&#34;&gt;Table and view usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick overview of who is viewing data is shown in the administration interface for both tables and views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a table, under the &lt;em&gt;Build Tables&lt;/em&gt; section of the lefthand navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go the the manage tab and click the &lt;em&gt;Usage&lt;/em&gt; icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report shows the number of times each user has viewed data from the table, per view. All views which contain any data from the table are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a view from the lefthand navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the manage tab and click the &lt;em&gt;Usage&lt;/em&gt; icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar data is show as for tables, but limited to the selected view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;individual-record-histories&#34;&gt;Individual record histories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any user can see the complete history of changes to an individual record, up to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/#retention-periods&#34;&gt;retention period&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When editing a record, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the precise time of a change, hover over a date.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Table layouts</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/table-layouts/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/table-layouts/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;For each table, agileBase will automatically build a data entry form for users to view, add and edit records with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout of this form can be controlled by selecting a layout option and adding separators to create blocks i.e. groups of fields which go together. This will create a more pleasant and usable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;layout&#34;&gt;Layout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout option is the main control. There are three options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;single column&lt;/strong&gt; - a simple vertical list of fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blocks in two columns&lt;/strong&gt; - makes the best use of screen space for large forms. Also allows tabs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All fields before the first separator are displayed in a section at the top of the screen, in two columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, each separator added creates a new block of fields. Blocks are arranged in two &amp;lsquo;newspaper&amp;rsquo; style columns which are displayed below the top section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the table has tabs, they are displayed below the top section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;process flow&lt;/strong&gt; - blocks of fields are arranged vertically one after each other, works well when there the data entry form maps to a set process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what the same data entry form looks like in each of the three configurations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and here&amp;rsquo;s an example of &lt;strong&gt;2. blocks in two columns&lt;/strong&gt; with tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;separators&#34;&gt;Separators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To form a block, click on the &lt;em&gt;fields&lt;/em&gt; tab of a table and add a field of type &amp;lsquo;separator&amp;rsquo; - see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;fields reference&lt;/a&gt;. Move it to where the start of the block should be i.e. before the first field in the block.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;backups&#34;&gt;Backups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data backups are performed across the stack of technology, from server down to databases and file storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database and agileBase content (uploaded files, custom templates etc.) backups are taken daily and hosted in the European Union by Amazon. Older backups transition to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/&#34;&gt;Amazon Glacier&lt;/a&gt; and are kept for 200 days - this allows a balance between the practical necessity of allowing rollbacks to a certain point in time, whilst not storing data for an unnecessarily long period, to comply with the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These backups are encrypted so that Amazon has no access to the data within then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backup and recovery process is monitored and tested regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;retrieval&#34;&gt;Retrieval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a charge for retrieval of customer data from backup, to cover our costs. The data will be restored to a separate instance of agileBase available at a different URL, which a customer can look at to compare data. If necessary, data can then be extracted from one and loaded into the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that depending on needs, this may be a complex process due to the fact that other data in the live system may have changed since the backup. A simple overwrite of existing data may not be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-policy&#34;&gt;Privacy policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;agileBase Ltd is funded directly by the customers we provide services to, we do not have any other business model, particularly we do not resell any data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Tabs</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/tabs/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/tabs/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Tabs are one way of exposing relationships between tables, to allow the user to navigate the structure of an application. For example, in a companies table, a contacts tab may show all the people employed at that particular company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface can display more than two levels of structure on screen in other ways (e.g. showing a menu in a tab) and wherever the user is, they can navigate up or down the hierarchy of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-a-tab&#34;&gt;Adding a tab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the &lt;em&gt;Build Tables&lt;/em&gt; menu in the lefthand sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the table you wish to add a tab to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the pencil icon in the toolbar to edit the table, then select the table&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &amp;lsquo;Choose child tabs for the form&amp;rsquo;, select an option in the &lt;em&gt;Add a tab&lt;/em&gt; dropdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tab-types&#34;&gt;Tab types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of tab, those which show a &lt;strong&gt;single record&lt;/strong&gt; and those which show &lt;strong&gt;multiple records&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type used depends on the relation field in the child table used in the tab, which links to the main table. If it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;one-to-one&lt;/a&gt;, then a single record is shown in the tab. If it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/table-layouts/&#34;&gt;one to many&lt;/a&gt;, then a view appears embedded in the tab, with which the user can choose a record to edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one to one example may be showing a tab of specification information against an ingredient for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: screenshot of spec tab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one to many may be a list of suppliers who supply that ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: screenshot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tab-options&#34;&gt;Tab options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, these options are only needed to finnesse an application. They can be useful to look at once the core of the structure is built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tab-view&#34;&gt;Tab view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one to many tabs, which &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt; to use to show items. By creating a specific view to use for the tab, you can control which fields are displayed in which order, add calculations, filter those which are shown etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;populate-from-template&#34;&gt;Populate from template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a tab, a button allows the user to add records. For example in the contacts tab of an organisation, they would be able to add a new contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in some situations you want to pre-populate the tab with records, rather than make the user create each one manually. An example might be order lines for a customer order in a telesales system. The order lines could be initially pre-populated with regular items the customer orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of doing that is to use the &amp;lsquo;Populate from template&amp;rsquo; view, first creating a new view to use for this purpose. The view must contain the record ID field of the parent table (e.g. customer orders in our example). When the user clicks on the tab, if there are no records present yet, it will prompt to populate the tab. Each row from the view where the record ID matches that of the parent record (cutomer order) will be used to create a record in the tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any calculations in the view &lt;strong&gt;with the same name&lt;/strong&gt; as a field in the tab table will be used to populate values in the records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of auto-populating data is to use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;workflow which runs on record creation&lt;/a&gt; or in the background. You can choose whichever method works best for a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;show-only-if-in-view&#34;&gt;Show only if in view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This option allows you to control tab visibility - whether the tab is visible on screen or not at any time depends on whether the main record appears in the view chosen. This works exactly the same way as &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;field visibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;colour-from-view&#34;&gt;Colour from view&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colour of each tab can be chosen. For example, different steps of a process may each be represented by a tab. Once a step is complete, the tab may be coloured green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set this up, create a view from the main (parent) table. It should contain a text calculation called &amp;lsquo;colour&amp;rsquo; which outputs the name of a colour e.g. green, or a blank value for no colour. The colour names are the same as those for &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;record flagging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;name&#34;&gt;Name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default the tab is named the same as the table used. However, you can override that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-inline-editing&#34;&gt;Use inline editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed up intensive data entry by allowing each field in the tab view to be edited inline. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example using an order processing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: example screenshot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;show-relation-fields&#34;&gt;Show relation fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is un-ticked (which it is by default), any relation fields in the tab table will be hidden. This can be useful if you want to reduce the complexity exposed to the user. They can load all data including relations by navigating to the full record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choose-a-record-when-a-new-item-is-added&#34;&gt;Choose a record when a new item is added&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used when a tab shows a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/relational-database-concepts/#a-more-complex-example&#34;&gt;join (also called a junction) table&lt;/a&gt;. To continue the example from that page, when adding a link between supplier and raw materials, if the raw materials table had a tab showing links, this option would cause the user to be immediately prompted for a supplier when adding a link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accept-emails-from-parent-table&#34;&gt;Accept emails from parent table&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redirect any incoming emails to the parent table to be stored in this tab. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/options/#accept-emails-to-this-address&#34;&gt;table options&lt;/a&gt; for details of receiving emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-tabs-for-the-same-table&#34;&gt;Multiple tabs for the same table&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note about tabs. In a small number of cases, one table A may have two relations to the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; table B. For example, a record of a contract between two parties may have a relation to the customer and supplier, both of which are records in an organisations table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you may want to add two tabs to the organisations table, one to show contracts for which a particular organisation is a customer, another for which they are a supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do that - just add two tabs for the same table. The system will use the first relation it finds for the first tab, the second for the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is a recursive Bill Of Materials (BOM) system where a join table may link to a parent item and a child item.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: To grandchild records</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/to-grandchild-records/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/to-grandchild-records/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/tabs/&#34;&gt;Tabs&lt;/a&gt; allow navigation from a parent record to a child, e.g. an organisation to a contact, order to order line, recipe to ingredient etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that child record may itself have subsidiary records of its own, e.g. a contact may have a tab for their training records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that&amp;rsquo;s the case, agileBase exposes both tiers of data on screen so the user can jump from the top level, in this example the organisation, directly to a contact&amp;rsquo;s training records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of navigation manifests in different ways according to the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a child links to the parent with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;one-to-one relation&lt;/a&gt;, then links to &amp;lsquo;grandchildren&amp;rsquo; are displayed by a menu in a tab. Here&amp;rsquo;s a menu showing the various grandchild items under a product&amp;rsquo;s specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: screenshot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s a many-to-one, then grandchildren are represented by blocks at the end of the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: screenshot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the special case when a grandchild tab&amp;rsquo;s tab view contains the ID of both its immediate parent and the parent above that, then the grandchild contents are shown directly, underneath the child record. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example where there&amp;rsquo;s a three tier structure of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supplier approval -&amp;gt; risk assessment -&amp;gt; risk assessment scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the user looks at a supplier approval record, the risk assessment summary and scores can both be seen at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Sensitive data</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/sensitive-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/sensitive-data/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In a table&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; tab, there are two options which are worth considering if the data is storing commercially sensitive information (plenty of information in most customer systems falls under this category!) or personal information as defined by EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When either option is ticked, two controls appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notify-administrators-on-export&#34;&gt;Notify administrators on export&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can enter a number. When a user exports more than that number of records at once to spreadsheet, all administrators (users with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges/#assigning-the-administrator-privilege&#34;&gt;administrator&lt;/a&gt; privilege) are notified by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disallow-exports&#34;&gt;Disallow exports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a number, representing a hard limit on the number of records which can be exported from this table at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/exporting/&#34;&gt;exporting&lt;/a&gt; for how to set up export privileges. Exports are disallowed by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;This table contains personal data, sensitive data or data about children&lt;/strong&gt; is ticked, a number of additional data entry boxes appear, to let you record the GDPR-relevant considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is for informational purposes only and doesn&amp;rsquo;t by itself ensure compliance with the GDPR!. We recommend looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/&#34;&gt;ICO website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-exfiltration-information&#34;&gt;Potential exfiltration information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When either option is ticked, some additional information is shown that can highlight opportunities for data to be exported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any API views which send data to third party systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any roles which are set up to allow exporting and which have users with privileges to see the table data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Docs: Upwards Navigation</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/upwards-navigation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/upwards-navigation/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Whenever a relation field is used in a table, the user has the option to navigate to the related record by clicking a link next to the relation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However its useful to know that if the relation is one of the first fields in the table, then it will be treated as having greater importance by the user interface. In this case, the relation will appear as a relation heading, making it clear the &amp;lsquo;parent-child&amp;rsquo; relationship i.e. that one record &amp;lsquo;belongs&amp;rsquo; to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in a contacts table, if the relation to a contact&amp;rsquo;s organisation is one of the first fields in the form, the organisation name will appear as a heading for the contact record. It will be a hyperlink so can be used to navigate to the parent organisation easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A record can have multiple &amp;lsquo;parents&amp;rsquo; of different types, e.g. a contact may belong to both an organisation and a site or department within that organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Select the table you wish to edit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the pencil icon in the toolbar to edit the table, then select the table&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Options&lt;/em&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;allow-add&#34;&gt;Allow add&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is ticked (it is by default), users can add records to the table. Anyone with manage privileges on the table can add tables regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;only-from-within-tab&#34;&gt;Only from within tab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is ticked, users can add records but only when accessing this table&amp;rsquo;s form from within a tab of a parent record. This can help ensure that child records are always connected to a parent and aren&amp;rsquo;t created as &amp;lsquo;orphans&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;allow-clone&#34;&gt;Allow clone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Off by default). Show a clone record button when a user is viewing a record. This makes a simple copy of all data in the record. The contents of tabs are not cloned. A more advanced clone facility can be created with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;allow-remove&#34;&gt;Allow remove&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On by default). Allow records to be deleted by people with EDIT privileges as well as people with MANAGE privileges, who can always delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;allow-share&#34;&gt;Allow share&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showa button which allows links to individual records to be shared between users using email. Note - recipients still need a login and relevant privileges to see the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-a-records-created-run-this-workflow&#34;&gt;When a record&amp;rsquo;s created, run this workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; immediately after the creation of a record. The workflow runs after any field default values have been set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-this-workflow-whenever-each-record-is-viewed&#34;&gt;Run this workflow whenever each record is viewed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as running the workflow on record creation, also run it whenever a user views a record in this table. Be aware this may have a performance impact for users, if the workflow is resource intensive and/or multi-step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-entry-from-external-sources&#34;&gt;Data entry from external sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options in this section are for configuring the table to allow an API request from an external source to create and edit records. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;API use&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-options&#34;&gt;Other options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;records-lockable&#34;&gt;Records lockable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Records can be locked to prevent editing. You may like to do this based on criteria e.g. once a customer order has been sent, it should be locked against further changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To actually lock the record, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locked records can be manually unlocked by someone with manage privileges on the table, but only one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-notifications&#34;&gt;Email notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone adds a comment to a record, when selecting recipients, they have the option to email those recipients, as well as adding the comment to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;comment stream&lt;/a&gt;. Ticking this table option sets the default to send emails for any comment added to this table. Users can override this on an individual comment basis and recipients can override in their notification preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flag-records-with-colour&#34;&gt;Flag records with colour&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter a field name here and add a field with the same name to a view, to flag records. The contents of the field must be one of the colour names as given on the screen. The field added to the view can be a calculation, specifically a hidden calculation. This will flag the view without showing the colour name on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to colour individual table fields or calculations in a view (as opposed to this option which flags the whole row). See the options for &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;field colouring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;calculation colouring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accept-emails-to-this-address&#34;&gt;Accept emails to this address&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system can accept incoming emails and attach them to relevant records e.g. attaching an email from a customer to that customer&amp;rsquo;s record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular email address can be set up to receive emails. The system can be configured to either accept emails from anyone, or just from users. If just from users, then users can forward any emails they receive to the system to have them imported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email text will be logged as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; against the record, with the full email attached if it is HTML formatted or includes attachments. The table must have a comments field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilechilli.com/contact-us/&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d like to set that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;information&#34;&gt;Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the options, some structural information is shown, such as which tables depend on this one i.e. have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;relation&lt;/a&gt; to it, how many fields and views per tile there are. See also the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/usage-reporting/#the-dashboard&#34;&gt;usage dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
