      <description>A separator field doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually store any data, but is used as a marker of the start of a block of fields. Create a separator and move it to just before the field which should be the first in a block.&#xA;Depending on the table layout, these blocks will be displayed in different ways, but in all cases will form a distinct group of fields.&#xA;Inline help can be added for separators in the same way as for normal fields, by adding a field description.</description>

      <description>Adding a comment feed to a table adds a discussion area to a form, transforming its usefulness.&#xA;Comment feeds in Agilebase are quite a large topic, as one of the most often used features central to the platform. It&amp;rsquo;s common for at least one comment feed to be added to every table in the system, allowing users to collaborate and discuss data wherever they are.&#xA;The ability to discuss and comment on data can be one of the most important mechanisms used to break down silo thinking and help organisations that wish to adopt a more systematic or process orientated view of things.</description>

      <description>Most fields in a table allow data entry into that table, but referenced data fields allow data from other places to be embedded, specifically views, created from any table.&#xA;Optionally, the embedded data can be editable.&#xA;This can be used for many purposes, such as&#xA;showing warning or information messages in a form, based on criteria showing calculations, e.g. when editing a recipe, you may want to show the total cost/kg of all ingredients and packaging in that recipe embedding charts, e.</description>

      <title>Automatically present fields</title>

      <description>When every table is created, a series of fields are automatically added. These aren&amp;rsquo;t displayed in the data entry form of a table, but are available to be added into views.&#xA;ID field In database parlance, the table&amp;rsquo;s primary key - providing a unique ID to identify each record. Values are generated in sequence.&#xA;Agilebase creates and manages primary keys, using them to link related tables together automatically, however it&amp;rsquo;s useful for administrators to understand the concept and implementation.</description>
