      <title>Docs: Separators</title>

        &lt;p&gt;A separator field doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually store any data, but is used as a marker of the start of a block of fields. Create a separator  and move it to just before the field which should be the first in a block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/table-layouts/&#34;&gt;table layout&lt;/a&gt;, these blocks will be displayed in different ways, but in all cases will form a distinct group of fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inline help can be added for separators in the same way as for normal fields, by adding a field description. This help text will apply to the whole block of fields created by a separator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a system with&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: blocks screenshot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Comment Feeds</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/comment-feeds/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/comment-feeds/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Adding a comment feed to a table adds a discussion area to a form, transforming its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment feeds in agileBase are quite a large topic, as one of the most often used features central to the platform. It&amp;rsquo;s common for at least one comment feed to be added to every table in the system, allowing users to collaborate and discuss data wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to discuss and comment on data can be one of the most important mechanisms used to break down silo thinking and help organisations that wish to adopt a more systematic or process orientated view of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comment-feeds-in-action&#34;&gt;Comment feeds in action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a comment feed in a table, being used to add a new comment. Previous comments can be seen underneath, with the user and date/time of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: screenshot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available recipients are those people who have privileges to view data in the table (it&amp;rsquo;s no use sending a comment to someone who can&amp;rsquo;t see the data being discussed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface intelligently selects an initial list of recipients from those available, but they can be added or removed by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, A and B (TODO) have been set to receive email notifications as well. The email they receive will contain a link to take them directly to the record the comment was added to. They can reply to the email to log an additional comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who aren&amp;rsquo;t recipients of a comment will still see the comment when they visit the record it&amp;rsquo;s been added to, they just won&amp;rsquo;t get a notification in their comments stream or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are mentioned by name in a comment (TODO in this example) will get an in-app alert as well as the comment appearing in their comment stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user&amp;rsquo;s notification options affect whether they receive comments from a particular table or person by default, and how they receive those comments. The table option &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/options/#accept-emails-to-this-address&#34;&gt;email notifications&lt;/a&gt; also affects this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-comments-stream-tile&#34;&gt;The comments stream tile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone&amp;rsquo;s the receipient of a comment, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see it in the comments stream tile on their homepage. Clicking on it will navigate to the related record. We won&amp;rsquo;t go into every detail of the user interface in this administrator documentation, but comments can be searched and the comments tile can be expanded to full screen like any other tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;email-integration&#34;&gt;Email integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above, anyone who receives a comment notification can reply to the email to add another comment (their email address must be their username or recorded in their user defailt), or they can click on a link to view the related record including previous comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, comments are also the mechanism by which emails from external parties can be logged - see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/options/#accept-emails-to-this-address&#34;&gt;accept emails to this address&lt;/a&gt; table option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;chaser&lt;/a&gt; sends an outgoing email, that is logged as a comment (including any attachments) too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slack-integration&#34;&gt;Slack integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slack.com&#34;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is integrated via &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;company options&lt;/a&gt;, every comment added will also be sent to your Slack workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs: Referenced data</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/referenced-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/referenced-data/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Most fields in a table allow data entry into that table, but referenced data fields allow data from &lt;strong&gt;other&lt;/strong&gt; places to be embedded, specifically &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;views&lt;/a&gt;, created from any table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optionally, the embedded data can be editable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be used for many purposes, such as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;showing calculations, e.g. when editing a recipe, you may want to show the total cost/kg of all ingredients and packaging in that recipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;embedding charts, e.g. in the record for a customer, you may want to show the last 12 months of sales data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing quick editing of related data, e.g. after selecting a customer contact for a sales opportunity, allow quick editing of their contact details without having to navigate away from the opportunity record&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more esoteric uses are also possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;referenced data can be used as a source of data to populate standard fields in the form, i.e. to provide default values for fields - see &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;relation field options&lt;/a&gt; for more information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a referenced data field can be displayed as a button to &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;manually run a workflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-a-referenced-field&#34;&gt;Adding a referenced field&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referenced fields are based on views. The contents of a view will be displayed in the form where a field referencing data from that view is added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works is that the chosen view must contain the ID field of the table the referenced field is added to. When displaying data, the view is filtered to only show records where the ID matches that of the record being edited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the sales opportunity example from above. You wish to include details of a selected contact in an opportunity record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, create a view of contacts linked to each opportunity. It may have fields in it such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** TODO: screenshot of example data in spreadsheet **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note - ID fields aren&amp;rsquo;t usually displayed to the user, they&amp;rsquo;re shown here to make the explanation easier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a field referencing this view is added to the opportunities table, the output may display like this, when editing a particular opportunity, e.g. number 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** TODO: screenshot **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to summarise, the steps are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;Create&lt;/a&gt; or find a view containing the data you wish to embed. It must contain the ID field of the table the data is embedded in (in this case &amp;lsquo;opportunities&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/#adding-a-field&#34;&gt;Add a field&lt;/a&gt; of type &lt;em&gt;referenced data&lt;/em&gt;. Select the table your target view was created from, then the target view itself, before pressing &lt;em&gt;create field&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there is one case in which the rule that the view must contain the ID of the table the referenced data is being added to. That&amp;rsquo;s when you want to show &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; rows from the view, without filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is typically used in a minority of cases, but can be useful when you want to embed data that isn&amp;rsquo;t related to the target table. For example, showing some global settings that may affect the functionality of a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;showing-one-or-more-rows&#34;&gt;Showing one or more rows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If more than one row in the view has an ID matching the ID of the table being added to, all will be shown. There is limited space in a form, so if there are lots, then a &amp;lsquo;see more&amp;rsquo; option will appear after the first few rows. For a more compact view, &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;tabular display&lt;/a&gt; can be chosen in the referenced field options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;showing-charts&#34;&gt;Showing charts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the view used has one or more &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt;, they will be shown instead of the data rows. The filtering acts exactly the same way, only data matching the containing table&amp;rsquo;s ID is used as the source of the chart data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** TODO: screenshot of embedded chart **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-referenced-data-editable&#34;&gt;Making referenced data editable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optionally, referenced data can be made editable by clicking on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A view containing the containing table&amp;rsquo;s ID can be created one of two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a view from the containing table, &lt;a href=&#34;https://todo.com&#34;&gt;joining&lt;/a&gt; to other tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a view from another table, joining it to the containing table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a view is built the second way and embedded into the table via a referenced field, the data will be editable: clicking on an element of referenced data will turn it into a data entry form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s built the first way, data will not be editable&lt;/p&gt;
