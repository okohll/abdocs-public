      <description>These are the core types of fields by which data can be entered by users (or other sources such as the API or a workflow).&#xA;Text Text fields are the most commonly used. Depending on field options, text can be entered into a standard data entry control, a large box allowing rich formatting (bold, italic etc.), chosen from a dropdown of options or added as tags.&#xA;Number When adding a number field, select a precision from the dropdown.</description>

This means that any calculations that reference the field won&amp;rsquo;t have to be changed and won&amp;rsquo;t break due to mis-matching field names Copy all values from one field to another. The easiest way is to use a workflow Try to delete the old field.</description>
