### Introduction
You are now well on your way through the Agilebase journey. 
 
This level is suggested or 'unlocked' once a citizen developer has carried out a certain number of citizen development functions and has therefore started to learn how no code development works in a safe environment.

However to activate the level, it must be manually assigned by a Software Architect level user, as it allows changes to the system which can affect other users.

A citizen developer level 2 can
* create new views that everyone can see, from any table
	- edit them as per the citizen developer functionality above
	- additionally they can add and remove simple joins, to include data from other tables in a view
* remove views that they themselves have created (not those that others have)
* create their own [tables]({{<relref "/docs/tables">}})
	- add, edit and remove fields and tabs from those tables
	- edit basic properties of the fields
	- assign privileges (up to edit) on those tables, using existing roles or direct user privileges
* create [tiles]({{<relref "/docs/tiles">}}) and delete tiles they've added themselves
