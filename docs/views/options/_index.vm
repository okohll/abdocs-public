Some options control the interface that a user sees (whether it's displayed in rows and columns, with headings, or as cards in columns for example) and others affect the contents of the view, i.e. which data records it contains.

Both types of option are accessed from the view as follows, we've just split them into the two types in this documentation for easy understanding.

1. In development mode, open a view (or open a view then toggle development mode on with the toggle switch at the top right of the screen)
2. Click the big pencil icon at the top left and select _properties and options_ from the menu
3. Some options are visible under _advanced options_
