        &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a youtube video explaining the concept of joins and running through the various types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9yeOJ0ZMUYw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just rememer, when using third party resources to learn about joins (or other SQL features), you don&amp;rsquo;t need to write the SQL code in agileBase, it&amp;rsquo;s generated for you behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;left-outer-and-inner-joins&#34;&gt;Left outer and inner joins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left outer join is the default type used when a join is added to a view in agileBase. It suits most cases, but can be changed after join creation if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A left outer join type will ensure that every row from the left source (table or view) is visible in output, whether or not the data links to a row on the right side. Conversely, when an inner join&amp;rsquo;s used, data from the left will be hidden unless it links to data on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may sound rather abstract: working with an example, we can see what it means in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take the common and straightforward example of linking contacts to organisations. We start by creating a view from the contacts table, so that&amp;rsquo;s on the left side. We then join from contacts to an organisations table, on the right. This join looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/example-join.png&#34; alt=&#34;example join&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gives us a view where we can add fields from the organisation table into the view of contacts data. The output may look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** TODO: screenshot **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each row representing a contact, has the contact details (name, email address etc.) and from the organisations table, you can see the name and website of the organisation they belong to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute, what&amp;rsquo;s that contact with blank spaces for the organisation name and website? That represents a &lt;strong&gt;contact which is not yet linked to an organisation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess to be nit-picky, it could represent a contact joined to an organisation without a name or website address added, but here we&amp;rsquo;ll assume all organisations have those details filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the join type is &lt;strong&gt;left outer&lt;/strong&gt;, then this row will be shown, as seen. However, if it&amp;rsquo;s changed to an &lt;strong&gt;inner&lt;/strong&gt; join, then it will be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why left outer is the safest type to use by default. Otherwise with an inner, if a user adds a new contact, fills in all their basic details but doesn&amp;rsquo;t link her or him to an organisation (perhaps they don&amp;rsquo;t know the organisation or it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the system yet), then they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see that contact in the view. And if they can&amp;rsquo;t see it, then they can&amp;rsquo;t click on it to load it - it will have vanished for good (well, until the join is changed back to a left outer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes of course, inner joins are very useful - but it makes sense that there must be a conscious decision to change a join to that type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;right-outer-and-full-outer&#34;&gt;Right outer and full outer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think, if there&amp;rsquo;s a left outer, is there also a right outer? There is, it means all data from the right side is always visible, whether or not there&amp;rsquo;s a match on the left. So in our contacts/organisations example, all organisations would be visible, whether or not any contacts belonged to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, this isn&amp;rsquo;t used much, as a right outer join is just the same as a left outer join started from the other table. There&amp;rsquo;s no difference in the data visible, but using a left outer works better in agileBase because you can be guaranteed that clicking on a row will load a record (with a right outer, if there&amp;rsquo;s no data on the left side, then no record can be loaded when the row&amp;rsquo;s clicked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also hear of a full outer join - this again has a very small number of useful cases, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2094793/when-is-a-good-situation-to-use-a-full-outer-join&#34;&gt;read about them online&lt;/a&gt; if interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;venn-diagram&#34;&gt;Venn diagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joins are often represented visually with Venn diagrams. Here&amp;rsquo;s a left outer join visualisation, showing all the data from the left side is visible, whether or not a matching row exists on the right, and an inner join diagram showing that data from the left is excluded without a match.&lt;/p&gt;
