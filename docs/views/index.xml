      <description>In Agilebase, a view &amp;lsquo;belongs to&amp;rsquo; a table. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what that means in more detail below, but for now, just choose a table to show data from to users. In examples on this section of the documentation we&amp;rsquo;ll assume we pick a contacts table.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll also assume we already have some tables and some tiles.&#xA;To create a view You can create a view from scratch, or clone an existing one then edit it.</description>

      <description>Filters can be applied permanently to a view, allowing an administrator to specify the subset of records that should be displayed. This is often for convenience and to create more useful systems. For example, if you have a database of suppliers, you may want to create views showing those which are approved, those which aren&amp;rsquo;t, those which are local etc. Each view would have a different set of filters applied.</description>
