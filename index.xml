      <description>As a no-code platform, Agilebase allows you to easily construct (and later de-construct or &amp;lsquo;refactor&amp;rsquo;) and change your software.&#xA;Toggling development mode on and off To get started, you need to toggle from &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; mode to &amp;lsquo;development&amp;rsquo; mode.&#xA;You can do this wherever you are in the system and you will switch to building or developing the item you&amp;rsquo;re looking at. The three main areas this covers are:&#xA;The homepage. Toggling to development mode on the homepage shows an overview of everything in the system - tables, views, tiles, roles and users can all be listed and edited.</description>

      <title>What is low code / no code?</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/introduction/what-is-no-code/</link>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/introduction/what-is-no-code/</guid>
      <description>Over the last two years low code / no code software has appeared to burst onto the scene from nowhere. The truth however is a bit less spectacular. Low code / no code platforms have been in development under the radar for at least a decade. What has changed now is the promise has become a reality.&#xA;Low code / no code promised to give users the power to produce bespoke systems, rather than have to rely on developers.</description>

      <description>Agilebase&amp;rsquo;s learner progression pathway enables you to transform your career. You can go from a citizen developer to a no-code software architect.&#xA;Citizen developers can create their own applications using no code. Software architects can build complex applications, including powerful workflow features and integrations with other applications.&#xA;To go on this journey requires no technical knowledge. Beginners - &amp;ldquo;citizen developers&amp;rdquo; - come from a diverse range of non-IT backgrounds. The only skills you need are the ability to think, be willing to learn, and be able to plan.</description>

      <title>What is a back office system?</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/introduction/what-is-a-back-office-system/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 09:57:55 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/introduction/what-is-a-back-office-system/</guid>
      <description>Back-office software solutions evolved with the emergence of cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) as a way of distinguishing them from front-office software, (which typically refers to software used for processes related to things like marketing, sales, interaction tracking, project management and other customer-facing activities).&#xA;Whilst Agilebase is widely used as front-office platform our unique strength is in our ability to support not only this front end but also the back-office.</description>

      <description>What is two factor authentication? Simply put, it helps to keep your company’s data more secure, to stop outsiders stealing it, editing or even deleting it.&#xA;When someone logs in from a new device or location, the system will prompt them for a code sent to or generated by their phone, to prove their identity.&#xA;If you’d like to dive into more detail, check out this video from authy.com: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds_TANz4n3U&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</description>

      <description>Agilebase is primarily a platform for building back office systems for employees (or members of the organisation) to use.&#xA;However, it&amp;rsquo;s common to allow access to people outside the organisation to perform limited data entry tasks. For example, you may wish your suppliers to be able to upload certificates of conformances to items they sell you, or you may have a large workforce of contractors who you require to fill in timesheets.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the start of the Agilebase journey. At this level you can create your own customisations, using no coding.&#xA;An Agilebase citizen developer can create &amp;lsquo;personal copies&amp;rsquo; of any view and edit those copies&#xA;remove or add fields, excepting any that are marked &amp;lsquo;confidential&amp;rsquo; (only higher level developers can access those fields) rearrange fields change field sorting add filters or remove filters (except on &amp;lsquo;confidential&amp;rsquo; fields) add and remove charts A confidential field is one that has a visibility rule, or is used for multi-tenanting.</description>

      <description>Learning Aim: Create a Table and associated Views to use it!&#xA;Prerequisites: User to have watched &amp;ldquo;How to use Agilebase&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Introduction This stage of the guide will introduce you to the basic activities required to build a simple application. We will start by creating a table with different types of fields in order to store a variety of data. We will then show you how to create and control tiles, views and forms which are the interfaces that your users will use to enter and consume this data.</description>

      <title>Why use Agilebase?</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/introduction/why-use-agilebase/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 09:57:55 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/introduction/why-use-agilebase/</guid>
      <description>&#xA;Agilebase has been created with some important aims in mind&#xA;to create software that people find enjoyable to use, which manifests in many ways, most obviously the attractive and colourful user interface, but also because it can match user&amp;rsquo;s requirements exactly to support the full ambitions of business owners. It&amp;rsquo;s simple to get started but the platform has a very high technical ceiling - there&amp;rsquo;s not much you can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish to make the most out of an organisation workforce&amp;rsquo;s perhaps un-tapped skills and experience, allowing people to take full ownership of their own areas of their business </description>

      <description>Backups Data backups are performed across the stack of technology, from server down to databases and file storage.&#xA;Database backups are taken daily and hosted in the European Union by Amazon. Older backups transition to Amazon Glacier and are kept for 200 days - this allows a balance between the practical necessity of allowing rollbacks to a certain point in time, whilst not storing data for an unnecessarily long period, to comply with the GDPR.</description>

      <title>Relational Database Concepts</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/relational-database-concepts/</guid>
      <description>Before diving into the details of building applications, starting with tables, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and learn some background information about databases, including what a table is. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip this section.&#xA;When building back office software with Agilebase, a large amount of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing is building database structures, to store user-entered data. Agilebase takes care of creating the user interface to allow users to use these structures automatically, e.</description>

      <title>Roles</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/</link>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/</guid>
      <description>The primary purpose of roles is to apply privileges to groups of users, rather than applying them individually. That makes managing large numbers of users easier and also more secure as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which privileges each type of user has and which they don&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure how to use roles, a good starting point might be to align them with the job roles in your organisation, or departments.</description>

      <description>Introduction You are now well on your way through the Agilebase journey.&#xA;This level is suggested or &amp;lsquo;unlocked&amp;rsquo; once a citizen developer has carried out a certain number of citizen development functions and has therefore started to learn how no code development works in a safe environment.&#xA;However to activate the level, it must be manually assigned by a Software Architect level user, as it allows changes to the system which can affect other users.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/guides/guide1-crm/adding-relational-data/</guid>
      <description>Learning Aim: Create related Tables to demonstrate the power of relational databases&#xA;Prerequisites: User to have watched “Creating a basic task list” video&amp;quot;&#xA;Introduction In this step of the guide we will build the engine of our CRM and in doing so start to introduce the concept of a relational database. We will do this as a practical example and you’ll see how agilebase makes this straight forward. We will be building a bigger system, but for the most part it’s simply reusing things we’ve already covered.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges/</guid>
      <description>In Agilebase, there are three privilege levels, as well as a special &amp;lsquo;develop&amp;rsquo; privilege.&#xA;The three privileges take effect per table, i.e. a user/role can have certain privileges on one table and different ones on another.&#xA;Privileges are additive - if a user is a member of multiple roles, they gain all the privileges from each of those roles added together, plus any they may have individually assigned.&#xA;Privilege levels View: ability to see data in a table Edit: ability to create, edit and delete data in a table (create and delete subject to various table options) Develop: the privilege that allows you to use the &amp;lsquo;application building&amp;rsquo; features of Agilebase, relating to a table.</description>

      <description>Tiles A tile on a user’s home screen represents an application or module of an application. It is a collection of data and functionality that forms a coherent whole For detailed information about Tiles visit&#xA;Let’s start by looking at the collection of tiles this system has configured Using the developer interface you can access your list of current tiles. Clicking on one provides access to the configuration options. Obviously setting the title is key as it provides the primary information to the user as to what purpose it serves.</description>

      <description>Introduction A Software Architect (see below) can, at their discretion, assign a citizen developer 3 &amp;lsquo;develop&amp;rsquo; privileges on a table (or tables).&#xA;That allows them to&#xA;add fields to those table, excluding referenced fields remove fields that they themselves have added (not others) edit the basic properties of any field in those tables, e.g. the list of options in a dropdown box Additionally, actions not related to having develop privileges on a particular table are</description>

      <description>A table is a store of data of a particular type e.g. a company, contact, product or invoice. Tables are the fundamental building blocks of an Agilebase application.&#xA;Using AI to add multiple tables Providing a short text prompt to the AI will let it suggest a suite of tables which will comprise a complete system.&#xA;For example, asking for a &amp;lsquo;Gym Membership system&amp;rsquo; might result in tables for&#xA;membership types members subscriptions payments classes class registrations trainers trainer schedules equipment equipment usage Agilebase will create all of these tables for you.</description>

      <description>Exporting to spreadsheet is only one way of getting data out of Agilebase, but it is the most commonly used amongst everyday users. For less ad-hoc data transfers, such as integrations with third party systems involving incoming and/or outgoing data, the API can be used.&#xA;Allowing exports In order for a user to be allowed to export to spreadsheet, a number of critieria have to be matched, to suitably protect your organisation&amp;rsquo;s data.</description>

      <description>Using Agilebase you can start small (perhaps in one team or department) and build apps iteratively to encompass a constantly widening range of business requirements. Many back office and CRM systems don&amp;rsquo;t typically store high volumes of data, but as systems grow its not uncommon to add transactional apps such as customer order processing for example, which can experience high throughput.&#xA;Agilebase supports all three stages of an organisation&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle - startup, scaling and growth.</description>

      <description>Capitalise field name By default Agilebase displays field names in Title Case. Un-ticking this option disables that, which can be useful for special cases like e.g. &amp;lsquo;pH&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Length (m)&amp;rsquo;, which would otherwise show as &amp;lsquo;PH&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Length (M)&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;Icon Rather than displaying a field name, show an icon, chosen from https://fontawesome.com/icons. For example, to show a phone icon for a phone number field, you could enter phone, for an email field envelope or a twitter handle twitter.</description>

      <description>Log data reporting provides a rich view of system usage.&#xA;Enhanced audit trail For organisations who have activated the enhanced audit trail, all logs are stored in user-accessible tables which are just like any other tables in the system, the only difference being the data is read only. This means an administrator can use the full power of the built in Agilebase reporting features, to create views, add calculations, charts etc.</description>

      <description>For each table, Agilebase will automatically build a data entry form for users to view, add and edit records with.&#xA;The layout of this form can be controlled by selecting a layout option and adding separators to create blocks i.e. groups of fields which go together. This will create a more pleasant and usable system.&#xA;Layout The layout option is the main control. There are three options:&#xA;single column - a simple vertical list of fields blocks in two columns - makes the best use of screen space for large forms.</description>

      <description>Records The Full record view is the interface that a user uses to update and create data in the underlying source Table.&#xA;This User Interface isn’t simply every field shown on the screen. The power of agilebase comes from providing facilities to control how the user interacts with their data. Put another way, by allowing developers to control individual fields, decide when to show them and group them together etc, the job of entering data becomes a pleasant user experience.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s possible for a developer to create a third party application, for example a phone or tablet app, that communicates with Agilebase via the API.&#xA;Now to use the API, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to authenticate as a user, as long as the app has the correct Authorization key(s), it can read and write data to Agilebase.&#xA;However, in some cases the app may need to confirm that someone has a valid Agilebase account before allowing them to use the app.</description>

      <description>A large variety of applications can be built using the Agilebase platform. Customers can start small (perhaps in one team or department, or a new startup business) and build apps iteratively to encompass a constantly widening range of business requirements.&#xA;Our costing structure has been developed to ensure fairness and affordability however far along an organisation is in their growth.&#xA;Costing is controlled by five factors&#xA;Users - the number of people who can log in Tables - a measure of the size of an application - how many capabilities does it cover?</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/creating-a-view/</guid>
      <description>In Agilebase, a view &amp;lsquo;belongs to&amp;rsquo; a table. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what that means in more detail below, but for now, just choose a table to show data from to users. In examples on this section of the documentation we&amp;rsquo;ll assume we pick a contacts table.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll also assume we already have some tables and some tiles.&#xA;To create a view You can create a view from scratch, or clone an existing one then edit it.</description>

      <description>These are the core types of fields by which data can be entered by users (or other sources such as the API or a workflow).&#xA;Text Text fields are the most commonly used. Depending on field options, text can be entered into a standard data entry control, a large box allowing rich formatting (bold, italic etc.), chosen from a dropdown of options or added as tags.&#xA;Number When adding a number field, select a precision from the dropdown.</description>

      <description>Learning Aim: Understand basic database privileges&amp;hellip; Roles and giving them to Users!&#xA;Prerequisites: To have built a multi table system, to have more than themselves as users.&#xA;Introduction AgileBase uses the classic concept of Roles to help you control the access users have to the system you are building. A classic metaphor would be the manager of an office has the keys to the building, whilst the staff do not. The person acting as the manager may change overtime, but the permission and privileges (in this case having keys) does not!</description>

      <description>Relations between tables are the &amp;lsquo;glue&amp;rsquo; that holds together an application built using Agilebase. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about this fundamental concept, please check out the relational database concepts page.&#xA;Some of the options for a relation field determine the nature of the links between tables, which can have a great effect on how an app works, so it&amp;rsquo;s very useful to know about them.&#xA;One to one only By default, a relation is a &amp;lsquo;many to one&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>Tabs</title>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/tabs/</guid>
      <description>Tabs are one way of exposing relationships between tables, to allow the user to navigate the structure of an application. For example, in a companies table, a contacts tab may show all the people employed at that particular company.&#xA;The user interface can display more than two levels of structure on screen in other ways (e.g. showing a menu in a tab) and wherever the user is, they can navigate up or down the hierarchy of data.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/to-grandchild-records/</guid>
      <description>Tabs allow navigation from a parent record to a child, e.g. an organisation to a contact, order to order line, recipe to ingredient etc.&#xA;Of course, that child record may itself have subsidiary records of its own, e.g. a contact may have a tab for their training records.&#xA;When that&amp;rsquo;s the case, Agilebase exposes both tiers of data on screen so the user can jump from the top level, in this example the organisation, directly to a contact&amp;rsquo;s training records.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/sensitive-data/</guid>
      <description>In a table&amp;rsquo;s privacy and security panel, there are two options which are worth considering if the data is storing commercially sensitive information (plenty of information in most customer systems falls under this category!) or personal information as defined by EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).&#xA;When either option is ticked, two controls appear.&#xA;Notify administrators on export Here you can enter a number. When a user exports more than that number of records at once to spreadsheet, all administrators (users with the administrator privilege) are notified by email.</description>

      <description>Accuracy Whether to record a date as just a year, year and month, year month and day, or with a time: hours, hh:mm, hh:mm:ss.&#xA;Use current time for new records If ticked, set the value of this field to the current time when a record is created&#xA;Date format The format to display in views. Note this doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect data entry screens, which use the browser&amp;rsquo;s standard date picker, which may customise to the user&amp;rsquo;s region.</description>

      <description>A separator field doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually store any data, but is used as a marker of the start of a block of fields. Create a separator and move it to just before the field which should be the first in a block.&#xA;Depending on the table layout, these blocks will be displayed in different ways, but in all cases will form a distinct group of fields.&#xA;Inline help can be added for separators in the same way as for normal fields, by adding a field description.</description>

      <description>Whenever a relation field is used in a table, the user has the option to navigate to the related record by clicking a link next to the relation.&#xA;However its useful to know that if the relation is one of the first fields in the table, i.e. at the top of the form, then it will be treated as having greater importance by the user interface. In this case, the relation will appear as a relation heading, making it clear the &amp;lsquo;parent-child&amp;rsquo; relationship i.</description>

      <description>Charting is not strictly an administrator function, as any user can create charts and other data visualisations, such as maps and word clouds.&#xA;However, it&amp;rsquo;s useful for administrators to know how the system works in outline, so they can support users and also because creating charts may be a key part of building an application.&#xA;In Agilebase, charts &amp;lsquo;belong to&amp;rsquo; a view. Each view can have a collection of charts. Users can toggle between viewing data rows and looking at charts based on those rows.</description>

However there is an easy to follow process to accomplish this.&#xA;Rename the field to [fieldname] old Add a new field [fieldname]. This means that any calculations that reference the field won&amp;rsquo;t have to be changed and won&amp;rsquo;t break due to mis-matching field names Copy all values from one field to another.

      <description>It can be important to ensure that certain rules are followed when data is entered, either manually by a user, by an incoming API request or someone filling in a chaser response.&#xA;When designing applications, just be aware there is sometimes a trade-off between the ideal of data integrity and everyday concerns.&#xA;For example, you may like to force users to always provide an email address for contacts but in a small minority of cases, they may not have that available.</description>

      <description>The workflow panel of a table shows any workflows which act on data in that table. In other words, any workflow that updates records, creates new records in the table, or deletes records from it.&#xA;Additionally, this panel allows you to choose a workflow to run whenever a new record is created, or (less frequently used) whenever a record is opened.&#xA;That can be very useful for setting initial values for fields, where those values may be more complex calculations than just a static default value.</description>

      <description>Filters can be applied permanently to a view, allowing an administrator to specify the subset of records that should be displayed. This is often for convenience and to create more useful systems. For example, if you have a database of suppliers, you may want to create views showing those which are approved, those which aren&amp;rsquo;t, those which are local etc. Each view would have a different set of filters applied.</description>

      <description>Adding a comment feed to a table adds a discussion area to a form, transforming its usefulness.&#xA;Comment feeds in Agilebase are quite a large topic, as one of the most often used features central to the platform. It&amp;rsquo;s common for at least one comment feed to be added to every table in the system, allowing users to collaborate and discuss data wherever they are.&#xA;The ability to discuss and comment on data can be one of the most important mechanisms used to break down silo thinking and help organisations that wish to adopt a more systematic or process orientated view of things.</description>

      <description>As a software architect in charge of the Agilebase system for your organisation, you may be called on to help people who have forgotten their password, or are having problems logging in for another reason.&#xA;Here are a few things you can do and check to help them get back in.&#xA;Precursor Firstly, if anyone reports login issues, make absolutely sure that it is really them requesting help. There are unfortunately an increasing number of ways that malicious people try to gain access to systems1, so have a process to check.</description>

      <description>Colour outliers Automatically highlight &amp;lsquo;unusual&amp;rsquo; values of this field in views. This can help pick out values which are notable in some way, for example if a number has been entered without a decimal point by mistake (1253 instead of 12.53) or is a statistical outlier.&#xA;Specifically, if the value is more than 4 standard deviations away from the mean, it&amp;rsquo;s strongly highlighted in green (for values greater than the mean) or red (for values less).</description>

      <description>When every table is created, a series of fields are automatically added. These aren&amp;rsquo;t displayed in the data entry form of a table, but are available to be added into views.&#xA;ID field In database parlance, the table&amp;rsquo;s primary key - providing a unique ID to identify each record. Values are generated in sequence.&#xA;Agilebase creates and manages primary keys, using them to link related tables together automatically, however it&amp;rsquo;s useful for administrators to understand the concept and implementation.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/file/document-templates/</guid>
      <description>Document templates in Agilebase are typically used to create output that needs to be printed or emailed, for example form letters and especially anything that needs to be branded. They can be used for some quite complex and large documents, for example one customer uses them to create branded multi-page reports that are sold to customers, complete with custom fonts, layouts, images and colours.&#xA;The same templating system is used for both generating documents (which can be done automatically with a workflow or manually) and displaying output to be printed.</description>

      <description>When systems get to a certain size, in particular when you start integrating with apps representing other parts of the business, then it can be beneficial to be able to test new developments and changes before putting them live.&#xA;For example, when accepting orders via an e-commerce website, or sending invoices to an accounting package, or accepting incoming stock change records from Goods In staff using a bar code scanning application.</description>

      <description>Do not auto-populate When this is un-ticked, the next number in the sequence will always be generated and saved for this field, whenever a new record is created.&#xA;When the option is ticked, the field value will be left blank when a new record is created. A button will appear in place of the value, which on pressed will create and save the next sequence value.&#xA;One benefit of this is to allow &amp;lsquo;accidental&amp;rsquo; creation of records without using up the next value in the sequence.</description>

      <description>It can be useful to include calculations and data from other parts of the system in a form, to add context and optionally allow editing of that related data.&#xA;To do that, a referenced data field can be added to the form. When adding this field, the administrator can choose a view to reference, the data from which will display in the form.&#xA;The way it works that a when a particular record is shown on screen in a form, the row ID of the record being edited is used to filter the results of that view.</description>

      <description>Firstly, identify the table into which you wish to receive incoming data. Edit that table and open the API panel. Tick &amp;lsquo;Public form or API data entry’, which will create an API for the table.&#xA;To protect the system from spam input, we also suggest you tick &amp;lsquo;Require API key’ and reload the table to show the API key generated.

      <description>Firstly, create a view which contains the data you wish to send In the &amp;lsquo;Use API&amp;rsquo; panel, enter a URL into the Push URL field. This is the URL that Agilebase will POST to when there’s new data. In the dropdown under that, Log time of push to, create a new date field (or choose an existing one). The API will update this field in a record when that record is included in a push to the external system The system will now make a POST to the URL specified in step 2 whenever there’s new data to send.</description>

      <description>When integrating Agilebase with third party systems, the API is really useful. Programmers can use it to send data to websites, to other software such as PowerBI, a Business Intelligence tool, or to external systems such as label/barcode printers for example. The opportunities are endless.&#xA;Agilebase can either ‘push’ data to a third party system, or have the third party system ‘pull’ it out.&#xA;What’s the difference? Simply put, if pulling, a third party system has to regularly ask, or &amp;lsquo;poll&amp;rsquo;, Agilebase whether there’s any new data.</description>

      <description>Where there is &amp;lsquo;child&amp;rsquo; data related to a parent table, e.g. a contact belonging to an organisation, a list of child records can be shown in a tab in the parent record.&#xA;A view can specify which records are shown. Perhaps some should be filtered out, like e.g. contacts who no longer work at the organisation - view filters can accomplish that.&#xA;The fields of the view are what&amp;rsquo;s shown in data rows in the tab.</description>

      <description>Agilebase can be used to send emails. This facility should NOT be used for marketing purposes, rather as a method to notify people about data associated to the system. For marketing emails, there are more appropriate specifically designed third party apps.&#xA;Note: When setting up an email alert, the system needs to know the email address of the recipient. Sometimes this may be very simple, when you always want to send the alert to the same person.</description>

      <description>The record editing form on screen can be programatically controlled to hide or show various elements, like tabs and individual fields. Fields can also be locked for editing and tabs can be coloured.&#xA;This allows relevant information to be shown/highlighted on screen - what is shown at any one time can change depending on the state of the data in the system. As a brief example, when a sales opportunity is closed, additional fields could appear asking for the outcome details to be recorded.</description>

      <description>When a relation field is part of a form, the user can choose a record to link to from a view of items in the related table.&#xA;That way, a subset of records can be shown relevant to the situation. For example, imagine there is a table of company records, which store customers and suppliers. When selecting a customer for a new invoice record, the user should be able to select only from companies which are customers, so a filtered view can be used.</description>

      <description>One of the most common methods of pushing data into other systems is to use Zapier, which is a ‘drag and drop’ integration tool that requires no programming (just like Agilebase itself).&#xA;We will use a worked example: building a system to send a ‘hello’ SMS message whenever a new contact is added to our database. In real life, you may send appointment reminders or other notifications by text. Of course Zapier integrations aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to sending text messages, there are tons of third party systems you can use, under many different categories, but text messages are a nice simple example to work through.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a great example of using an API to provide business benefits, that we use ourselves here at agileChilli. As well as outlining the steps necessary to set up the API, with links to other documentation pages where relevant, we also include other elements of the solution, like workflows and charting, which often form a part of integrations.&#xA;The scenario is that we want to be able to look up and store multiple years worth of financial data for any UK company we hold in our CRM system.</description>

      <description>When a comment is added to a record in Agilebase, a copy can be sent to your Slack or Teams workspace, to a specific channel appropriate to the tile.&#xA;In fact, the comment can be sent to any external service that accepts push notifications to a URL. We recommend setting up a webhook URL via an easy to use integration tool like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate. That tool can then be set up to post the message to any supported service of your choice.</description>

      <description>A spreadsheet export is the simplest way for everyday users to get data out of Agilebase without requiring that an administrator sets up an integration.&#xA;Details of how to allow this are in the security and compliance section.</description>

      <description>Agilebase allows data to be imported from CSV (Comma Separated Variable) files. All popular spreadsheet software can save data in this format.&#xA;Anyone with develop privileges on a table can import data into it.&#xA;In the tiles interface, load any view created from the table to import into. Scroll to the bottom of the rows and press the cloud import icon, then follow through the prompts.&#xA;Data can be imported in two ways.</description>

      <title>Authenticating users via the API</title>

      <description>Sometimes when developing an app that integrates with Agilebase, you may want to allow it to query the system to check the login details a user provides. In other words, let a user &amp;rsquo;log in&amp;rsquo; via your app.&#xA;The API mechanisms described in this section (push, pull etc.) don&amp;rsquo;t require a login to use, they work only via the API keys as described, however your app may still wish to test a users login to ensure they are a valid user.</description>

      <description>Agilebase can accept incoming emails and attach them to relevant records e.g. attaching an email from a customer to that customer&amp;rsquo;s record.&#xA;This works by creating an email address for the system. Any emails forwarded to that address, or cc&amp;rsquo;d or bcc&amp;rsquo;d to it will be saved in the database. Agilebase will check the people involved in the email (to:, from: and cc: addresses) and find the right record to attach it to.</description>

      <description>Standard workflows are automations that create, update or delete records.&#xA;AI workflows are exactly the same in that regard: a view is created which select the records to act on by filtering.&#xA;The only difference is that a standard workflow to update or create records will use SQL calculations to define the contents of the field values to be saved. For example, if a workflow creates an invoice record, it might define a calculation to save to a VAT amount field as</description>

      <description>How to chain Workflows To set the next workflow in a chain, simply set the appropriate view in the Chain workflow section of the workflow - edit records panel when editing a view. The next workflow in the chain will run as soon as the previous finishes.&#xA;Auto-connect new records to records created in previous chained workflow steps This option is available when using a workflow that creates new records. Say for example a workflow consists of two steps</description>

      <title>Recursive Workflows</title>

      <description>Recursion is a rather heavyweight feature of the workflow capabilities of the Agilebase platform.&#xA;If you’re interested in a bit of maths and want to know what that means, there’s a great tutorial about the concept at the Khan Academy.&#xA;If not, never mind, the takeaway is it allows an administrator to set up workflows that weren’t possible before, particularly where you have networks of people or things. For example, if your CRM links people who know each other, you could create a list of all people 1 step removed, 2 steps etc.</description>

      <description>Some workflows need to be run on an adhoc basis, initiated by a user. In these instances it can be useful to assign the Workflow to run behind a Button.&#xA;N.b. In both cases below it is necessary for the Workflow to marked as Manual.&#xA;Workflow Buttons on a Form To add the Workflow button to a Table&amp;rsquo;s form simply create a new field of type Referenced Data with the workflow as the source.</description>
