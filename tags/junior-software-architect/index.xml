      <description>Introduction A junior software architect can use practically all of the application building functionality of Agilebase. For example&#xA;Create workflows (including chasers, document generation) Set up APIs Add complex joins to views Create, edit and delete roles Assign privileges to roles or users up to the &amp;rsquo;edit&amp;rsquo; level Remove fields, views etc. created by anyone Edit the advanced properties of fields and views, including field visibility rules (confidentiality rules) for example Their only limitations are to do with managing the organisation as a whole, including other users.</description>

      <description>Learning Aim: Using Cross Reference (Xref) fields in a table definition to display related info. Introduce WorkFlows (Buttons, sending emails, document generation). Being organised by using a naming convention!&#xA;Prerequisites: User to have watched “Add a Sales Pipeline” and “Introducing calculated” video. Understand how to create calculations in views.&#xA;Introduction This part of the guide starts to introduce some more powerful and advanced features of the agileBase system. It looks at how we can give users of our basic CRM some power ups that make it a better user experience.</description>

      <description>Learning Aim: Understand basic database privileges&amp;hellip; Roles and giving them to Users!&#xA;Prerequisites: To have built a multi table system, to have more than themselves as users.&#xA;Introduction AgileBase uses the classic concept of Roles to help you control the access users have to the system you are building. A classic metaphor would be the manager of an office has the keys to the building, whilst the staff do not. The person acting as the manager may change overtime, but the permission and privileges (in this case having keys) does not!</description>

      <description>Before setting up a BI connection, please be aware of the data privacy and security considerations.&#xA;Any tool which utilises ODBC can be used, such as Excel for example. Power BI is a common one.&#xA;Initial Setup The first step is to contact us to request we prepare your account. This will also allow connections from Power BI or any other tool which can connect to ODBC).&#xA;If you use Power BI, then the process is as follows</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/calendar/</guid>
      <description>Any view with one or more date/time fields can have its data displayed in calendar form. If there are two date/time fields, the first will be the start time, the second the end time. If there&amp;rsquo;s only one, events will last 1 hour by default, unless the field is a date only, in which case they will be all day.&#xA;Data can also sync to and from external calendars using the API.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a Youtube video explaining the concept of joins and running through the various types.&#xA;Just remember, when using third party resources to learn about joins (or other SQL features), you don&amp;rsquo;t need to write the SQL code in Agilebase, it&amp;rsquo;s generated for you behind the scenes.&#xA;Left outer and inner joins The left outer join is the default type used when a join is added to a view in Agilebase.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/referenced-data/</guid>
      <description>Most fields in a table allow data entry into that table, but referenced data fields allow data from other places to be embedded, specifically views, created from any table.&#xA;Optionally, the embedded data can be editable.&#xA;This can be used for many purposes, such as&#xA;showing warning or information messages in a form, based on criteria showing calculations, e.g. when editing a recipe, you may want to show the total cost/kg of all ingredients and packaging in that recipe embedding charts, e.</description>

      <description>The primary purpose of a view is to show data to users. To let them see, search and report on it, or find individual records to edit.&#xA;However, some fundamental aspects of a view make it a very useful feature that can power many core capabilities of Agilebase, such as chasers, workflows and APIs, as well as being useful to administrators in many more minor ways.&#xA;A view being a filtered list of records, it can be used to specify those records to act on, i.</description>

      <title>Automatically present fields</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/automatically-present-fields/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/automatically-present-fields/</guid>
      <description>When every table is created, a series of fields are automatically added. These aren&amp;rsquo;t displayed in the data entry form of a table, but are available to be added into views.&#xA;ID field In database parlance, the table&amp;rsquo;s primary key - providing a unique ID to identify each record. Values are generated in sequence.&#xA;Agilebase creates and manages primary keys, using them to link related tables together automatically, however it&amp;rsquo;s useful for administrators to understand the concept and implementation.</description>

      <title>Document templates</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 08 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/fields/field-types/special-field-types/file/document-templates/</guid>
      <description>Document templates in Agilebase are typically used to create output that needs to be printed or emailed, for example form letters and especially anything that needs to be branded. They can be used for some quite complex and large documents, for example one customer uses them to create branded multi-page reports that are sold to customers, complete with custom fonts, layouts, images and colours.&#xA;The same templating system is used for both generating documents (which can be done automatically with a workflow or manually) and displaying output to be printed.</description>

      <description>There are a number of ways to extract data from Agilebase, whether manually for an individual&amp;rsquo;s use or programatically for integration with other systems.&#xA;There are also multiple ways other than the user interface to enter data into Agilebase.&#xA;Outgoing Data Users are able to:&#xA;Export Data to spreadsheet Generate Docs via a template Access attached files Print screen information Third parties can access data via an API, either:&#xA;PULL data PUSH data There is also dedicated facility for integrating data with a Calendar</description>

      <description>A workflow is a task that processes data to achieve a particular function. Agilebase has a number of workflow functions that can be used to automate or simplify the activities users would otherwise need to perform manually.&#xA;Workflows can automatically edit records and create new records, saving a lot of manual typing. The system will follow rules for creating new records, editing values in existing records or taking other actions. The rules can be simple or complex, in fact anything that can be represented by a standard view, which makes it quite powerful.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/workflows/types-of-actions/</guid>
      <description>Types of Action Actions fall in to two types:&#xA;Those that effect data held within Agilebase tables Those that send data to another system. Alter Data Use the dropdown within the workflow - edit records panel when editing the view to control the action that will be applied to every record in the view. Options are:&#xA;Create record - This will create a new item in the nominated table Update record - This will alter the values of the record.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/special-uses/apis/</guid>
      <description>Any view can be used to generate an API - a unique URL which third party services can call in order to extract data, or which can be used to push data to those services and applications.&#xA;The view created in this case is used to define the set of records to send and the fields to include.&#xA;For more information, see the integrations topic, which contains full details of how to set up and use APIs.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/workflows/altering-data/</guid>
      <description>The following workflow types alter data within the system&#xA;Create record - This will create a new item in the nominated table Update record - This will alter the values of the record. Lock record - This will apply a record level lock on the item. Delete record - This will totally remove the record. Deleting records is not reversible. Please use with caution.&#xA;Specifying field values to save When creating or editing a record, the fields in the view will populate the new or existing record.</description>

      <pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/special-uses/referenced-data-panels/</guid>
      <description>It can be useful to include calculations and data from other parts of the system in a form, to add context and optionally allow editing of that related data.&#xA;To do that, a referenced data field can be added to the form. When adding this field, the administrator can choose a view to reference, the data from which will display in the form.&#xA;The way it works that a when a particular record is shown on screen in a form, the row ID of the record being edited is used to filter the results of that view.</description>

      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 16:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/setting-up-the-post-api/</guid>
      <description>Firstly, identify the table into which you wish to receive incoming data. Edit that table and open the API panel. Tick &amp;lsquo;Public form or API data entry’, which will create an API for the table.&#xA;To protect the system from spam input, we also suggest you tick &amp;lsquo;Require API key’ and reload the table to show the API key generated. This then has to be submitted with every POST request as the value of the HTTP Authorization header.</description>

      <description>Type The type of document typically stored by this field. Can be&#xA;Document - such as a PDF file or spreadsheet for example Image/photo Profile photo The selection affects the display in the user interface in some ways. In particular when a profile photo field is moved to the start of the record, it is displayed as part of the record header.&#xA;Image resolution This option allows you to specify that the system should automatically down-size any large images uploaded.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/setting-up-the-push-api/</guid>
      <description>Firstly, create a view which contains the data you wish to send In the &amp;lsquo;Use API&amp;rsquo; panel, enter a URL into the Push URL field. This is the URL that Agilebase will POST to when there’s new data. In the dropdown under that, Log time of push to, create a new date field (or choose an existing one). The API will update this field in a record when that record is included in a push to the external system The system will now make a POST to the URL specified in step 2 whenever there’s new data to send.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/workflows/send-email/</guid>
      <description>Agilebase can be used to send emails. This facility should NOT be used for marketing purposes, rather as a method to notify people about data associated to the system. For marketing emails, there are more appropriate specifically designed third party apps.&#xA;Note: When setting up an email alert, the system needs to know the email address of the recipient. Sometimes this may be very simple, when you always want to send the alert to the same person.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/setting-up-the-pull-api/</guid>
      <description>Connections to Agilebase are made using standard HTTP calls. This makes it easy for developers in any language, so PHP, Java, even JavaScript in a browser can be used.&#xA;The first step is to create a view in Agilebase that contains the data you want to make available to other apps. You can use the standard view creation features of the administrator interface, including adding fields and calculations, sorts and filters.</description>

      <description>The Chaser email facility is often used to remind people to send information. This facility is a dedicated tool, optimised to this purpose.&#xA;In a nutshell, the system comprises three parts&#xA;checking when something’s due and emailing the person who needs to supply it&#xA;allowing the recipient to easily provide the data by following a link in the email to an online form. Documents can be uploaded and other information filled in</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/special-uses/controlling-form-user-interfaces/</guid>
      <description>The record editing form on screen can be programatically controlled to hide or show various elements, like tabs and individual fields. Fields can also be locked for editing and tabs can be coloured.&#xA;This allows relevant information to be shown/highlighted on screen - what is shown at any one time can change depending on the state of the data in the system. As a brief example, when a sales opportunity is closed, additional fields could appear asking for the outcome details to be recorded.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/special-uses/related-record-pickers/</guid>
      <description>When a relation field is part of a form, the user can choose a record to link to from a view of items in the related table.&#xA;That way, a subset of records can be shown relevant to the situation. For example, imagine there is a table of company records, which store customers and suppliers. When selecting a customer for a new invoice record, the user should be able to select only from companies which are customers, so a filtered view can be used.</description>

For example, if your CRM links people who know each other, you could create a list of all people 1 step removed, 2 steps etc.</description>

      <description>Some workflows need to be run on an adhoc basis, initiated by a user. In these instances it can be useful to assign the Workflow to run behind a Button.&#xA;N.b. In both cases below it is necessary for the Workflow to marked as Manual.&#xA;Workflow Buttons on a Form To add the Workflow button to a Table&amp;rsquo;s form simply create a new field of type Referenced Data with the workflow as the source.</description>
