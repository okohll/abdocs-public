      <description>In these pages you can find details of how to set up users, roles, and privileges in Agilebase. Agilebase has an extensive role-based permissions system that enables fine-grained permissions and roles to be used.&#xA;Tables of data can also be marked as containing commercially sensitive or personal data, relevant to GDPR and affecting application behaviour.</description>

      <description>As a no-code platform, Agilebase allows you to easily construct (and later de-construct or &amp;lsquo;refactor&amp;rsquo;) and change your software.&#xA;Toggling development mode on and off To get started, you need to toggle from &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; mode to &amp;lsquo;development&amp;rsquo; mode.&#xA;You can do this wherever you are in the system and you will switch to building or developing the item you&amp;rsquo;re looking at. The three main areas this covers are:&#xA;The homepage. Toggling to development mode on the homepage shows an overview of everything in the system - tables, views, tiles, roles and users can all be listed and edited.</description>

      <description>People from many different backgrounds use Agilebase to create software that solves problems for them and their organisations. Some are seasoned IT professionals, who are able to code but are new to the no-code world. Some have used tools like Microsoft Access or newer no-code tools and many if not most are from outside of the IT world completely.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a place for everyone - to encourage this diversity and ensure people can pick up Agilebase at whatever level is most appropriate, we&amp;rsquo;ve designed our unique five step Learner Progression route.</description>

      <description>Agilebase&amp;rsquo;s learner progression pathway enables you to transform your career. You can go from a citizen developer to a no-code software architect.&#xA;Citizen developers can create their own applications using no code. Software architects can build complex applications, including powerful workflow features and integrations with other applications.&#xA;To go on this journey requires no technical knowledge. Beginners - &amp;ldquo;citizen developers&amp;rdquo; - come from a diverse range of non-IT backgrounds. The only skills you need are the ability to think, be willing to learn, and be able to plan.</description>

      <description>Agilebase often works best when end users become part of the development process, so they&amp;rsquo;re able to give feedback as your software builds up, also gaining confidence in the end result. So it&amp;rsquo;s quite likely that you&amp;rsquo;ll be adding user accounts relatively early in the process.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to adopt security best practices from the start rather than trying to retro-fit. This guide will take you through the mechanics of creating User Accounts but also explain the steps you can take to ensure data is suitably protected.</description>

      <description>What is two factor authentication? Simply put, it helps to keep your company’s data more secure, to stop outsiders stealing it, editing or even deleting it.&#xA;When someone logs in from a new device or location, the system will prompt them for a code sent to or generated by their phone, to prove their identity.&#xA;If you’d like to dive into more detail, check out this video from authy.com: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds_TANz4n3U&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</description>

      <description>AI is used in many core features of Agilebase: to give you ideas about what to build, help to build those systems and build more advanced features more quickly than you would be able to do on your own as you progress your learning.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s possible, with a few simple prompts, for Agilebase&amp;rsquo;s AI to build a complete system for you from scratch, for whatever you want (a CRM system for a charity, an asset tracking system for a film production company, or whatever you want to describe).</description>

      <description>Agilebase is primarily a platform for building back office systems for employees (or members of the organisation) to use.&#xA;However, it&amp;rsquo;s common to allow access to people outside the organisation to perform limited data entry tasks. For example, you may wish your suppliers to be able to upload certificates of conformances to items they sell you, or you may have a large workforce of contractors who you require to fill in timesheets.</description>

      <description>Learning Aim: Create a Table and associated Views to use it!&#xA;Prerequisites: User to have watched &amp;ldquo;How to use Agilebase&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Introduction This stage of the guide will introduce you to the basic activities required to build a simple application. We will start by creating a table with different types of fields in order to store a variety of data. We will then show you how to create and control tiles, views and forms which are the interfaces that your users will use to enter and consume this data.</description>

      <description>Backups Data backups are performed across the stack of technology, from server down to databases and file storage.&#xA;Database backups are taken daily and hosted in the European Union by Amazon. Older backups transition to Amazon Glacier and are kept for 200 days - this allows a balance between the practical necessity of allowing rollbacks to a certain point in time, whilst not storing data for an unnecessarily long period, to comply with the GDPR.</description>

      <description>Before diving into the details of building applications, starting with tables, let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and learn some background information about databases, including what a table is. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip this section.&#xA;When building back office software with Agilebase, a large amount of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing is building database structures, to store user-entered data. Agilebase takes care of creating the user interface to allow users to use these structures automatically, e.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/</guid>
      <description>The primary purpose of roles is to apply privileges to groups of users, rather than applying them individually. That makes managing large numbers of users easier and also more secure as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which privileges each type of user has and which they don&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;Roles have some other important uses, such as multi-tenanting, described below.&#xA;Creating a role Go to the homepage and toggle development mode on 42 Click the &amp;lsquo;+ ROLE&amp;rsquo; button at the top right of the screen You should now see an editing screen with the details of the role you just created.</description>

      <description>A tile on a user&amp;rsquo;s home screen represents an application or module of an application - a collection of data and functionality that forms a coherent whole.&#xA;There are four types of tile, each of which present data in a different way.&#xA;Data tile the most common tile type - from the administrator&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint this is a collection of views. The user can navigate the views, search for data, edit records etc.</description>

      <description>Learning Aim: Create related Tables to demonstrate the power of relational databases&#xA;Prerequisites: User to have watched “Creating a basic task list” video&amp;quot;&#xA;Introduction In this step of the guide we will build the engine of our CRM and in doing so start to introduce the concept of a relational database. We will do this as a practical example and you’ll see how agilebase makes this straight forward. We will be building a bigger system, but for the most part it’s simply reusing things we’ve already covered.</description>

      <description>A table is a store of data of a particular type e.g. a company, contact, product or invoice. Tables are the fundamental building blocks of an Agilebase application.&#xA;Using AI to add multiple tables Providing a short text prompt to the AI will let it suggest a suite of tables which will comprise a complete system.&#xA;For example, asking for a &amp;lsquo;Gym Membership system&amp;rsquo; might result in tables for&#xA;membership types members subscriptions payments classes class registrations trainers trainer schedules equipment equipment usage Agilebase will create all of these tables for you.</description>

      <description>Exporting to spreadsheet is only one way of getting data out of Agilebase, but it is the most commonly used amongst everyday users. For less ad-hoc data transfers, such as integrations with third party systems involving incoming and/or outgoing data, the API can be used.&#xA;Allowing exports In order for a user to be allowed to export to spreadsheet, a number of critieria have to be matched, to suitably protect your organisation&amp;rsquo;s data.</description>

      <description>Capitalise field name By default Agilebase displays field names in Title Case. Un-ticking this option disables that, which can be useful for special cases like e.g. &amp;lsquo;pH&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Length (m)&amp;rsquo;, which would otherwise show as &amp;lsquo;PH&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Length (M)&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;Icon Rather than displaying a field name, show an icon, chosen from https://fontawesome.com/icons. For example, to show a phone icon for a phone number field, you could enter phone, for an email field envelope or a twitter handle twitter.</description>

      <description>For each table, Agilebase will automatically build a data entry form for users to view, add and edit records with.&#xA;The layout of this form can be controlled by selecting a layout option and adding separators to create blocks i.e. groups of fields which go together. This will create a more pleasant and usable system.&#xA;Layout The layout option is the main control. There are three options:&#xA;single column - a simple vertical list of fields blocks in two columns - makes the best use of screen space for large forms.</description>

      <description>Along with tables, views are one of the two foundational concepts used when building applications with Agilebase.&#xA;What is a view? In fact, the concept of a view is not unique to Agilebase, it is a core part of any database system, including the PostgreSQL database that Agilebase uses to store, manipulate and report on data.&#xA;Here are some of the advantages a view can offer, as explained by the Wikipedia Article on database views, slightly shortened.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s possible for a developer to create a third party application, for example a phone or tablet app, that communicates with Agilebase via the API.&#xA;Now to use the API, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to authenticate as a user, as long as the app has the correct Authorization key(s), it can read and write data to Agilebase.&#xA;However, in some cases the app may need to confirm that someone has a valid Agilebase account before allowing them to use the app.</description>

      <description>In Agilebase, a view &amp;lsquo;belongs to&amp;rsquo; a table. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what that means in more detail below, but for now, just choose a table to show data from to users. In examples on this section of the documentation we&amp;rsquo;ll assume we pick a contacts table.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll also assume we already have some tables and some tiles.&#xA;To create a view You can create a view from scratch, or clone an existing one then edit it.</description>

      <description>These are the core types of fields by which data can be entered by users (or other sources such as the API or a workflow).&#xA;Text Text fields are the most commonly used. Depending on field options, text can be entered into a standard data entry control, a large box allowing rich formatting (bold, italic etc.), chosen from a dropdown of options or added as tags.&#xA;Number When adding a number field, select a precision from the dropdown.</description>

      <description>Relations between tables are the &amp;lsquo;glue&amp;rsquo; that holds together an application built using Agilebase. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about this fundamental concept, please check out the relational database concepts page.&#xA;Some of the options for a relation field determine the nature of the links between tables, which can have a great effect on how an app works, so it&amp;rsquo;s very useful to know about them.&#xA;One to one only By default, a relation is a &amp;lsquo;many to one&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/tabs/</guid>
      <description>Tabs are one way of exposing relationships between tables, to allow the user to navigate the structure of an application. For example, in a companies table, a contacts tab may show all the people employed at that particular company.&#xA;The user interface can display more than two levels of structure on screen in other ways (e.g. showing a menu in a tab) and wherever the user is, they can navigate up or down the hierarchy of data.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/hierarchy-navigation/to-grandchild-records/</guid>
      <description>Tabs allow navigation from a parent record to a child, e.g. an organisation to a contact, order to order line, recipe to ingredient etc.&#xA;Of course, that child record may itself have subsidiary records of its own, e.g. a contact may have a tab for their training records.&#xA;When that&amp;rsquo;s the case, Agilebase exposes both tiers of data on screen so the user can jump from the top level, in this example the organisation, directly to a contact&amp;rsquo;s training records.</description>

      <description>In a table&amp;rsquo;s privacy and security panel, there are two options which are worth considering if the data is storing commercially sensitive information (plenty of information in most customer systems falls under this category!) or personal information as defined by EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).&#xA;When either option is ticked, two controls appear.&#xA;Notify administrators on export Here you can enter a number. When a user exports more than that number of records at once to spreadsheet, all administrators (users with the administrator privilege) are notified by email.</description>

      <description>The ability to add calculations to a view opens up a world of possibilities. Within the confines of the SQL language, there&amp;rsquo;s no limit to what you can do, and those confines contain a pretty large space.&#xA;This is the only area of Agilebase which requires some &amp;lsquo;semi-programming&amp;rsquo; to use - using snippets of SQL. However, SQL is a standard, widely popular and the AI is there to help as you get started.</description>

      <description>A separator field doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually store any data, but is used as a marker of the start of a block of fields. Create a separator and move it to just before the field which should be the first in a block.&#xA;Depending on the table layout, these blocks will be displayed in different ways, but in all cases will form a distinct group of fields.&#xA;Inline help can be added for separators in the same way as for normal fields, by adding a field description.</description>

      <description>Whenever a relation field is used in a table, the user has the option to navigate to the related record by clicking a link next to the relation.&#xA;However its useful to know that if the relation is one of the first fields in the table, i.e. at the top of the form, then it will be treated as having greater importance by the user interface. In this case, the relation will appear as a relation heading, making it clear the &amp;lsquo;parent-child&amp;rsquo; relationship i.</description>

      <description>Charting is not strictly an administrator function, as any user can create charts and other data visualisations, such as maps and word clouds.&#xA;However, it&amp;rsquo;s useful for administrators to know how the system works in outline, so they can support users and also because creating charts may be a key part of building an application.&#xA;In Agilebase, charts &amp;lsquo;belong to&amp;rsquo; a view. Each view can have a collection of charts. Users can toggle between viewing data rows and looking at charts based on those rows.</description>

However there is an easy to follow process to accomplish this.&#xA;Rename the field to [fieldname] old Add a new field [fieldname]. This means that any calculations that reference the field won&amp;rsquo;t have to be changed and won&amp;rsquo;t break due to mis-matching field names Copy all values from one field to another.

      <description>It can be important to ensure that certain rules are followed when data is entered, either manually by a user, by an incoming API request or someone filling in a chaser response.&#xA;When designing applications, just be aware there is sometimes a trade-off between the ideal of data integrity and everyday concerns.&#xA;For example, you may like to force users to always provide an email address for contacts but in a small minority of cases, they may not have that available.</description>

      <description>Filters can be applied permanently to a view, allowing an administrator to specify the subset of records that should be displayed. This is often for convenience and to create more useful systems. For example, if you have a database of suppliers, you may want to create views showing those which are approved, those which aren&amp;rsquo;t, those which are local etc. Each view would have a different set of filters applied.</description>

      <description>By default, a file field added to a table will let users upload files.&#xA;When a file field is added to a view, a link to download the file is included.&#xA;Files previews can be displayed in an image/document library tile.&#xA;Version history When a new file is uploaded (or generated), any previous file is kept as a previous version, displayed with a timestamp, for download by users.&#xA;Generating PDF documents If a template is uploaded using the file field options, the file upload button in the user interface will be replaced by a generate button.</description>

      <description>There are a number of ways to extract data from Agilebase, whether manually for an individual&amp;rsquo;s use or programatically for integration with other systems.&#xA;There are also multiple ways other than the user interface to enter data into Agilebase.&#xA;Outgoing Data Users are able to:&#xA;Export Data to spreadsheet Generate Docs via a template Access attached files Print screen information Third parties can access data via an API, either:&#xA;PULL data PUSH data There is also dedicated facility for integrating data with a Calendar</description>

Use the following code to help…&#xA;to_char( trunc ( {start time} ), ‘00’ ) || ‘:’ || trim( to_char( ( {start time} - trunc ( {start time} ) ) * 60, ‘00’) ) Using that, the number 0.</description>

      <description>It can be useful to include calculations and data from other parts of the system in a form, to add context and optionally allow editing of that related data.&#xA;To do that, a referenced data field can be added to the form. When adding this field, the administrator can choose a view to reference, the data from which will display in the form.&#xA;The way it works that a when a particular record is shown on screen in a form, the row ID of the record being edited is used to filter the results of that view.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/setting-up-the-post-api/</guid>
      <description>Firstly, identify the table into which you wish to receive incoming data. Edit that table and open the API panel. Tick &amp;lsquo;Public form or API data entry’, which will create an API for the table.&#xA;To protect the system from spam input, we also suggest you tick &amp;lsquo;Require API key’ and reload the table to show the API key generated. This then has to be submitted with every POST request as the value of the HTTP Authorization header.</description>

      <description>Firstly, create a view which contains the data you wish to send In the &amp;lsquo;Use API&amp;rsquo; panel, enter a URL into the Push URL field. This is the URL that Agilebase will POST to when there’s new data. In the dropdown under that, Log time of push to, create a new date field (or choose an existing one). The API will update this field in a record when that record is included in a push to the external system The system will now make a POST to the URL specified in step 2 whenever there’s new data to send.</description>

      <description>Where there is &amp;lsquo;child&amp;rsquo; data related to a parent table, e.g. a contact belonging to an organisation, a list of child records can be shown in a tab in the parent record.&#xA;A view can specify which records are shown. Perhaps some should be filtered out, like e.g. contacts who no longer work at the organisation - view filters can accomplish that.&#xA;The fields of the view are what&amp;rsquo;s shown in data rows in the tab.</description>

      <description>Agilebase automatically takes some measures behind the scenes to maintain high performance as data volumes grow.&#xA;There are other mechanisms that can be manually enabled such as caching and increasing the memory assigned to particular views.&#xA;Finally, we will be happy to to do all we can to speed up any parts of your application that require it if you contact us. Often, a solution as simple as manually adding an index to a particular field can speed up requests by multiple orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>Connections to Agilebase are made using standard HTTP calls. This makes it easy for developers in any language, so PHP, Java, even JavaScript in a browser can be used.&#xA;The first step is to create a view in Agilebase that contains the data you want to make available to other apps. You can use the standard view creation features of the administrator interface, including adding fields and calculations, sorts and filters.</description>

      <description>The record editing form on screen can be programatically controlled to hide or show various elements, like tabs and individual fields. Fields can also be locked for editing and tabs can be coloured.&#xA;This allows relevant information to be shown/highlighted on screen - what is shown at any one time can change depending on the state of the data in the system. As a brief example, when a sales opportunity is closed, additional fields could appear asking for the outcome details to be recorded.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/special-uses/related-record-pickers/</guid>
      <description>When a relation field is part of a form, the user can choose a record to link to from a view of items in the related table.&#xA;That way, a subset of records can be shown relevant to the situation. For example, imagine there is a table of company records, which store customers and suppliers. When selecting a customer for a new invoice record, the user should be able to select only from companies which are customers, so a filtered view can be used.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/push-example-zapier/</guid>
      <description>One of the most common methods of pushing data into other systems is to use Zapier, which is a ‘drag and drop’ integration tool that requires no programming (just like Agilebase itself).&#xA;We will use a worked example: building a system to send a ‘hello’ SMS message whenever a new contact is added to our database. In real life, you may send appointment reminders or other notifications by text. Of course Zapier integrations aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to sending text messages, there are tons of third party systems you can use, under many different categories, but text messages are a nice simple example to work through.</description>

      <description>When a comment is added to a record in Agilebase, a copy can be sent to your Slack or Teams workspace, to a specific channel appropriate to the tile.&#xA;In fact, the comment can be sent to any external service that accepts push notifications to a URL. We recommend setting up a webhook URL via an easy to use integration tool like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate. That tool can then be set up to post the message to any supported service of your choice.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when developing an app that integrates with Agilebase, you may want to allow it to query the system to check the login details a user provides. In other words, let a user &amp;rsquo;log in&amp;rsquo; via your app.&#xA;The API mechanisms described in this section (push, pull etc.) don&amp;rsquo;t require a login to use, they work only via the API keys as described, however your app may still wish to test a users login to ensure they are a valid user.</description>
