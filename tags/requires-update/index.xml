      <description>In Agilebase, there are three privilege levels, as well as a special &amp;lsquo;develop&amp;rsquo; privilege.&#xA;The three privileges take effect per table, i.e. a user/role can have certain privileges on one table and different ones on another.&#xA;Privileges are additive - if a user is a member of multiple roles, they gain all the privileges from each of those roles added together, plus any they may have individually assigned.&#xA;Privilege levels View: ability to see data in a table Edit: ability to create, edit and delete data in a table (create and delete subject to various table options) Develop: the privilege that allows you to use the &amp;lsquo;application building&amp;rsquo; features of Agilebase, relating to a table.</description>
