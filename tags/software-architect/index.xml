      <description>In these pages you can find details of how to set up users, roles, and privileges in Agilebase. Agilebase has an extensive role-based permissions system that enables fine-grained permissions and roles to be used.&#xA;Tables of data can also be marked as containing commercially sensitive or personal data, relevant to GDPR and affecting application behaviour.</description>

      <description>Agilebase often works best when end users become part of the development process, so they&amp;rsquo;re able to give feedback as your software builds up, also gaining confidence in the end result. So it&amp;rsquo;s quite likely that you&amp;rsquo;ll be adding user accounts relatively early in the process.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to adopt security best practices from the start rather than trying to retro-fit. This guide will take you through the mechanics of creating User Accounts but also explain the steps you can take to ensure data is suitably protected.</description>

      <description>AI is used in many core features of Agilebase: to give you ideas about what to build, help to build those systems and build more advanced features more quickly than you would be able to do on your own as you progress your learning.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s possible, with a few simple prompts, for Agilebase&amp;rsquo;s AI to build a complete system for you from scratch, for whatever you want (a CRM system for a charity, an asset tracking system for a film production company, or whatever you want to describe).</description>

      <description>Agilebase is primarily a platform for building back office systems for employees (or members of the organisation) to use.&#xA;However, it&amp;rsquo;s common to allow access to people outside the organisation to perform limited data entry tasks. For example, you may wish your suppliers to be able to upload certificates of conformances to items they sell you, or you may have a large workforce of contractors who you require to fill in timesheets.</description>

      <description>Backups Data backups are performed across the stack of technology, from server down to databases and file storage.&#xA;Database backups are taken daily and hosted in the European Union by Amazon. Older backups transition to Amazon Glacier and are kept for 200 days - this allows a balance between the practical necessity of allowing rollbacks to a certain point in time, whilst not storing data for an unnecessarily long period, to comply with the GDPR.</description>

      <title>Roles</title>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/roles/</guid>
      <description>The primary purpose of roles is to apply privileges to groups of users, rather than applying them individually. That makes managing large numbers of users easier and also more secure as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see which privileges each type of user has and which they don&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure how to use roles, a good starting point might be to align them with the job roles in your organisation, or departments.</description>

      <title>Privileges</title>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/privileges/</guid>
      <description>In Agilebase, there are three privilege levels, as well as a special &amp;lsquo;develop&amp;rsquo; privilege.&#xA;The three privileges take effect per table, i.e. a user/role can have certain privileges on one table and different ones on another.&#xA;Privileges are additive - if a user is a member of multiple roles, they gain all the privileges from each of those roles added together, plus any they may have individually assigned.&#xA;Privilege levels View: ability to see data in a table Edit: ability to create, edit and delete data in a table (create and delete subject to various table options) Develop: the privilege that allows you to use the &amp;lsquo;application building&amp;rsquo; features of Agilebase, relating to a table.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/exporting/</guid>
      <description>Exporting to spreadsheet is only one way of getting data out of Agilebase, but it is the most commonly used amongst everyday users. For less ad-hoc data transfers, such as integrations with third party systems involving incoming and/or outgoing data, the API can be used.&#xA;Allowing exports In order for a user to be allowed to export to spreadsheet, a number of critieria have to be matched, to suitably protect your organisation&amp;rsquo;s data.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/security-and-compliance/security-features/usage-monitoring/usage-reporting/</guid>
      <description>Log data reporting provides a rich view of system usage.&#xA;Enhanced audit trail For organisations who have activated the enhanced audit trail, all logs are stored in user-accessible tables which are just like any other tables in the system, the only difference being the data is read only. This means an administrator can use the full power of the built in Agilebase reporting features, to create views, add calculations, charts etc.</description>

      <description>Agilebase comprehensively logs changes to data in the system as well as changes to the structure of the system. Powerful reporting facilities allow the generation of audit trails, trend monitoring, customer success monitoring etc.&#xA;What is logged User actions The following actions are recorded&#xA;logins, including connection details record edits (create, update and delete) global edits comment additions and removals data imports and exports viewing and searching/filtering data in views password resets When logging a record deletion, the data values deleted are logged.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s possible for a developer to create a third party application, for example a phone or tablet app, that communicates with Agilebase via the API.&#xA;Now to use the API, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to authenticate as a user, as long as the app has the correct Authorization key(s), it can read and write data to Agilebase.&#xA;However, in some cases the app may need to confirm that someone has a valid Agilebase account before allowing them to use the app.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/sensitive-data/</guid>
      <description>In a table&amp;rsquo;s privacy and security panel, there are two options which are worth considering if the data is storing commercially sensitive information (plenty of information in most customer systems falls under this category!) or personal information as defined by EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).&#xA;When either option is ticked, two controls appear.&#xA;Notify administrators on export Here you can enter a number. When a user exports more than that number of records at once to spreadsheet, all administrators (users with the administrator privilege) are notified by email.</description>

      <description>Once a field has been created, the type can&amp;rsquo;t be changed with the flick of a switch. However there is an easy to follow process to accomplish this.&#xA;Rename the field to [fieldname] old Add a new field [fieldname]. This means that any calculations that reference the field won&amp;rsquo;t have to be changed and won&amp;rsquo;t break due to mis-matching field names Copy all values from one field to another. The easiest way is to use a workflow Try to delete the old field.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/tables/data-integrity-checks/</guid>
      <description>It can be important to ensure that certain rules are followed when data is entered, either manually by a user, by an incoming API request or someone filling in a chaser response.&#xA;When designing applications, just be aware there is sometimes a trade-off between the ideal of data integrity and everyday concerns.&#xA;For example, you may like to force users to always provide an email address for contacts but in a small minority of cases, they may not have that available.</description>

      <description>To access these options, edit a table and select &amp;rsquo;tags and options&#39;.&#xA;Allow add If this is ticked (it is by default), users can add records to the table. Anyone with develop privileges on the table can add tables regardless.&#xA;Only from within tab If this is ticked, users can add records but only when accessing this table&amp;rsquo;s form from within a tab of a parent record. This can help ensure that child records are always connected to a parent and aren&amp;rsquo;t created as &amp;lsquo;orphans&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The workflow panel of a table shows any workflows which act on data in that table. In other words, any workflow that updates records, creates new records in the table, or deletes records from it.&#xA;Additionally, this panel allows you to choose a workflow to run whenever a new record is created, or (less frequently used) whenever a record is opened.&#xA;That can be very useful for setting initial values for fields, where those values may be more complex calculations than just a static default value.</description>

Use the following code to help…&#xA;to_char( ( to_timestamp(1.5 * 3600.0) AT TIME ZONE &amp;#39;UTC&amp;#39; ), &amp;#39;HH24:MI&amp;#39; ) Using that, the number 0.</description>

      <guid>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/workflows/send-data-to-a-third-party-via-api/</guid>
      <description>When integrating Agilebase with third party systems, the API is really useful. Programmers can use it to send data to websites, to other software such as PowerBI, a Business Intelligence tool, or to external systems such as label/barcode printers for example. The opportunities are endless.&#xA;Agilebase can either ‘push’ data to a third party system, or have the third party system ‘pull’ it out.&#xA;What’s the difference? Simply put, if pulling, a third party system has to regularly ask, or &amp;lsquo;poll&amp;rsquo;, Agilebase whether there’s any new data.</description>

      <description>Agilebase automatically takes some measures behind the scenes to maintain high performance as data volumes grow. And the underlying PostgreSQL database is pretty good at running queries very quickly.&#xA;As your system matures, you may find there are tweaks you can make to keep it running fast so that there&amp;rsquo;s a good user experience.&#xA;What can cause slowdowns? If anything seems to be running a bit slow it will almost always be down to the performance of a view.</description>

      <title>PUSH API worked example - Zapier</title>

      <description>One of the most common methods of pushing data into other systems is to use Zapier, which is a ‘drag and drop’ integration tool that requires no programming (just like Agilebase itself).&#xA;We will use a worked example: building a system to send a ‘hello’ SMS message whenever a new contact is added to our database. In real life, you may send appointment reminders or other notifications by text. Of course Zapier integrations aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to sending text messages, there are tons of third party systems you can use, under many different categories, but text messages are a nice simple example to work through.</description>

      <title>Complete API worked example</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a great example of using an API to provide business benefits, that we use ourselves here at agileChilli. As well as outlining the steps necessary to set up the API, with links to other documentation pages where relevant, we also include other elements of the solution, like workflows and charting, which often form a part of integrations.&#xA;The scenario is that we want to be able to look up and store multiple years worth of financial data for any UK company we hold in our CRM system.</description>

      <title>Comments integration</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/comments-integration/</link>

      <description>When a comment is added to a record in Agilebase, a copy can be sent to your Slack or Teams workspace, to a specific channel appropriate to the tile.&#xA;In fact, the comment can be sent to any external service that accepts push notifications to a URL. We recommend setting up a webhook URL via an easy to use integration tool like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate. That tool can then be set up to post the message to any supported service of your choice.</description>

      <title>Authenticating users via the API</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/integrations/testing-a-login/</link>

      <description>Sometimes when developing an app that integrates with Agilebase, you may want to allow it to query the system to check the login details a user provides. In other words, let a user &amp;rsquo;log in&amp;rsquo; via your app.&#xA;The API mechanisms described in this section (push, pull etc.) don&amp;rsquo;t require a login to use, they work only via the API keys as described, however your app may still wish to test a users login to ensure they are a valid user.</description>

      <title>Email Integration</title>

      <description>Agilebase can accept incoming emails and attach them to relevant records e.g. attaching an email from a customer to that customer&amp;rsquo;s record.&#xA;This works by creating an email address for the system. Any emails forwarded to that address, or cc&amp;rsquo;d or bcc&amp;rsquo;d to it will be saved in the database. Agilebase will check the people involved in the email (to:, from: and cc: addresses) and find the right record to attach it to.</description>
