      <description>People from many different backgrounds use Agilebase to create software that solves problems for them and their organisations. Some are seasoned IT professionals, who are able to code but are new to the no-code world. Some have used tools like Microsoft Access or newer no-code tools and many if not most are from outside of the IT world completely.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a place for everyone - to encourage this diversity and ensure people can pick up Agilebase at whatever level is most appropriate, we&amp;rsquo;ve designed our unique five step Learner Progression route.</description>

      <description>Agilebase&amp;rsquo;s learner progression pathway enables you to transform your career. You can go from a citizen developer to a no-code software architect.&#xA;Citizen developers can create their own applications using no code. Software architects can build complex applications, including powerful workflow features and integrations with other applications.&#xA;To go on this journey requires no technical knowledge. Beginners - &amp;ldquo;citizen developers&amp;rdquo; - come from a diverse range of non-IT backgrounds. The only skills you need are the ability to think, be willing to learn, and be able to plan.</description>

      <description>In Agilebase there are two mechanisms for charting and visualising data, each suited to a different purpose&#xA;our built-in charting exporting data to third party business intelligence tools If you&amp;rsquo;re starting out, we recommend beginning by looking at built-in charting.&#xA;For more advanced users, here&amp;rsquo;s a description of when each of the two options may be appropriate, with reasons why.&#xA;Built in charting This should be the default starting point.

      <title>Built In Charting</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/charting/built-in-charting/</link>

      <description>Charting is not strictly an administrator function, as any user can create charts and other data visualisations, such as maps and word clouds.&#xA;However, it&amp;rsquo;s useful for administrators to know how the system works in outline, so they can support users and also because creating charts may be a key part of building an application.&#xA;In Agilebase, charts &amp;lsquo;belong to&amp;rsquo; a view. Each view can have a collection of charts. Users can toggle between viewing data rows and looking at charts based on those rows.</description>

      <title>Filters</title>
      <link>https://docs.agilebase.co.uk/docs/views/filters/</link>

      <description>Filters can be applied permanently to a view, allowing an administrator to specify the subset of records that should be displayed. This is often for convenience and to create more useful systems. For example, if you have a database of suppliers, you may want to create views showing those which are approved, those which aren&amp;rsquo;t, those which are local etc. Each view would have a different set of filters applied.</description>
